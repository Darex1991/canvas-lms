@styleguide Badges

## Badges

You can easily create notification badges in two ways:

### Use the .ic-badge class

```html
<span class="ic-badge">9</span>
<span class="ic-badge ic-badge--success">99+</span>
<span class="ic-badge ic-badge--alert">25</span>
<span class="ic-badge ic-badge--danger">8</span>
```

### Use the ic-badge-maker mixin with your own class. It takes four arguments, detailed below.

```css
.my-awesome-badge {
  @include ic-badge-maker(
    22px, // how large should the badge be? Default is 20px.
    $ic-color-success, // background color
    $ic-color-light, // text color
    12px // font-size
    );
}
```

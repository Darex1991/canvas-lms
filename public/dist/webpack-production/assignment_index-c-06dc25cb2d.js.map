To help the user's experience, we want to hide sections that\n# have already been assigned a due date in the other drop downs. We also\n# want to make the interface very responsive, so adding changing the section\n# in one dropdown makes the section available to choose in all the other\n# dropdowns (since it was previously taken, but now available to choose from).\n# You can use the variable due date widget to see an example of this behavior.\n# (NOTE: The variable due date widget doesn't use this... yet)\n#\n# UniqueDropdownCollection will watch your models for change events, so\n# when your passed 'propertyName' value changes, UniqueDropdownCollection\n# will remove it from `collection.takenValues` and add it to\n# `collection.availableValues` accordingly. `availableValues` and\n# `takenValues` are both instances of `Backbone.Collection`, so you\n# can use the handy dandy `change/add/remove` events we all love. See\n# the documentation below for what kind of objects these collections\n# store the possible values as.\n#\n# You can also call `add/remove` like you would on a normal\n# `Backbone.Collection`. UniqueDropdownCollection will make a value\n# available if you remove the record, and taken if you create a new record\n# (the new record will have the first available value in `availableValues`.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# ENV.SECTION_IDS = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n# models = (new Assignment(id: i, section_id: i) for i in [1..3])\n#\n# collection = new UniqueDropdownCollection models,\n#   model: Assignment\n#   propertyName: 'section_id'\n#   possibleValues: ENV.SECTION_IDS\n#\n# collection.availableValues.find (m) -> m.get('value') == 4 # true\n# collection.takenValues.find (m) -> m.get('value') == 4 # false\n#\n# models[0].set 'section_id', 4\n#\n# collection.availableValues.find (m) -> m.get('value') == 4 # false\n# collection.takenValues.find (m) -> m.get('value') == 4 # true\n#\n# Listening for changes on `availableValues` and `takenValues`\n#\n# These collections have objects that look like this:\n#\n#   id: 'some value goes here'\n#   value: 'some value goes here'\n#\n# If you're going to listen on these collections, I recommend listening on\n# the `add/remove` events of the collections, and re-render your dropdown\n# accordingly.\n\nexport default class UniqueDropdownCollection extends Backbone.Collection\n\n  # Public\n  # records - Array of records to watch for changes on\n  # options: a hash with the usual options Backbone.Collection takes, with\n  # a few extra added goodies:\n  #   propertyName: string representing the property name on your model.\n  #     e.g. model.get('section_id')\n  #   possibleValues: an array of possible values `propertyName` can\n  #     choose from\n  #\n  # NOTE: BE SURE TO PASS A `model` OPTION!\n  initialize: (records, options={}) ->\n    @takenValues ||= new Backbone.Collection []\n    @availableValues ||= new Backbone.Collection []\n    {@possibleValues, @propertyName} = options\n    @availableValues.comparator = 'value'\n    @calculateTakenValues(records)\n\n    @on \"reset\", @calculateTakenValues\n    @on \"change:#{@propertyName}\", @updateAvailableValues\n    @on \"remove\", @removeModel\n\n  calculateTakenValues: (records) =>\n    if records instanceof Backbone.Collection\n      takenValues = records.map (m) => m.get(@propertyName)\n    else\n      takenValues = (model.get(@propertyName) for model in records)\n\n    # we need to reset the collections so that\n    # we can calculate the fresh taken and available values\n    @takenValues.reset null, silent: true\n    @availableValues.reset null, silent: true\n    # Create Backbone Models with IDs so we can remove and add them\n    # quickly (rather than filtering and removing from an index every time)\n    # in @takenValues and @availableValues\n    for takenValue in takenValues\n      @takenValues.add new Backbone.Model id: takenValue, value: takenValue\n\n    for value in _.difference @possibleValues, takenValues\n      @availableValues.add new Backbone.Model id: value, value: value\n\n\n  updateAvailableValues: (model) =>\n    previousValue = model.previousAttributes()[@propertyName]\n    currentValue = model.get(@propertyName)\n\n    previouslyAvailableValue = @availableValues.get currentValue\n    previouslyTakenValue = @takenValues.get previousValue\n\n    @availableValues.remove previouslyAvailableValue\n    @takenValues.remove previouslyTakenValue\n\n    @takenValues.add previouslyAvailableValue\n    @availableValues.add previouslyTakenValue\n\n\n  removeModel: (model) =>\n    value = model.get @propertyName\n    previouslyTakenValue = @takenValues.get value\n\n    @takenValues.remove previouslyTakenValue\n    @availableValues.add previouslyTakenValue\n\n  # method for how to find the next model to add.\n  # defaults to the first item\n  # in @availableValues\n  #\n  # override if you need more complex logic\n  #\n  # Returns a model from @availableValues\n  findNextAvailable: ->\n    @availableValues.at(0)\n\n  # overrides Backbone.Collection.add\n  add: (models, options) ->\n    # if we pass a plan object, modify it with an available value before\n    # passing it to the \"model\" constructor.\n    if !_.isArray(models) && (typeof models is 'object') && !(models instanceof Backbone.Model)\n      previouslyAvailableValue = @findNextAvailable()\n      @availableValues.remove previouslyAvailableValue\n      @takenValues.add previouslyAvailableValue\n      models[@propertyName] = previouslyAvailableValue.get 'value'\n\n    super\n\n\n","#\n# Copyright (C) 2013 - present Instructure, Inc.\n#\n# This file is part of Canvas.\n#\n# Canvas is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\n# the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free\n# Software Foundation, version 3 of the License.\n#\n# Canvas is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\n# WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR\n# A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Multi-select will likely have to be in a separate component\n\n  <CanvasSelect\n    id=\"your-id\"\n    label=\"select's label\"\n    value={value}             // should match the ID of the selected option\n    onChange={handleChange}   // function(event, selectedOption)\n    {...otherPropsPassedToTheUnderlyingSelect}  // if you need to (width=\"100%\" is a popular one)\n  >\n    <CanvasSelect.Option key=\"1\" id=\"1\" value=\"1\">one</CanvasSelect.Option>\n    <CanvasSelect.Option key=\"2\" id=\"2\" value=\"2\">two</CanvasSelect.Option>\n    <CanvasSelect.Option key=\"3\" id=\"3\" value=\"3\">three</CanvasSelect.Option>\n  </CanvasSelect>\n---\n*/\n\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {func, node, string, oneOfType} from 'prop-types'\nimport {compact, castArray, isEqual} from 'lodash'\nimport I18n from 'i18n!app_shared_components'\nimport {Select} from '@instructure/ui-select'\nimport {Alert} from '@instructure/ui-alerts'\nimport {matchComponentTypes} from '@instructure/ui-react-utils'\n\nconst noOptionsOptionId = '_noOptionsOption'\n\n// CanvasSelectOption and CanvasSelectGroup are components our client can create thru CanvasSelect\n// to pass us our options.

You can specify various properties\n  that your computed property is dependent on. This will force the cached\n  result to be recomputed if the dependencies are modified.\n\n  In the following example we declare a computed property (by calling\n  `.property()` on the fullName function) and setup the properties\n  dependencies (depending on firstName and lastName). The fullName function\n  will be called once (regardless of how many times it is accessed) as long\n  as it's dependencies have not been changed. Once firstName or lastName are updated\n  any future calls (or anything bound) to fullName will incorporate the new\n  values.\n\n  ```javascript\n  Person = Ember.Object.extend({\n    // these will be supplied by `create`\n    firstName: null,\n    lastName: null,\n\n    fullName: function() {\n      var firstName = this.get('firstName');\n      var lastName = this.get('lastName');\n\n     return firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n    }.property('firstName', 'lastName')\n  });\n\n  var tom = Person.create({\n    firstName: \"Tom\",\n    lastName: \"Dale\"\n  });\n\n  tom.get('fullName') // \"Tom Dale\"\n  ```\n\n  You can also define what Ember should do when setting a computed property.\n  If you try to set a computed property, it will be invoked with the key and\n  value you want to set it to. You can also accept the previous value as the\n  third parameter.\n\n  ```javascript\n\n Person = Ember.Object.extend({\n    // these will be supplied by `create`\n    firstName: null,\n    lastName: null,\n\n    fullName: function(key, value, oldValue) {\n      // getter\n      if (arguments.length === 1) {\n        var firstName = this.get('firstName');\n        var lastName = this.get('lastName');\n\n        return firstName + ' ' + lastName;\n\n      // setter\n      } else {\n        var name = value.split(\" \");\n\n        this.set('firstName', name[0]);\n        this.set('lastName', name[1]);\n\n        return value;\n      }\n    }.property('firstName', 'lastName')\n  });\n\n  var person = Person.create();\n  person.set('fullName', \"Peter Wagenet\");\n  person.get('firstName') // Peter\n  person.get('lastName') // Wagenet\n  ```\n\n  @class ComputedProperty\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.Descriptor\n  @constructor\n*/\nfunction ComputedProperty(func, opts) {\n  this.func = func;\n  \n    this._dependentKeys = opts && opts.dependentKeys;\n  \n\n  this._cacheable = (opts && opts.cacheable !== undefined) ? opts.cacheable : true;\n  this._readOnly = opts && (opts.readOnly !== undefined || !!opts.readOnly);\n}\n\nEmber.ComputedProperty = ComputedProperty;\nComputedProperty.prototype = new Ember.Descriptor();\n\nvar ComputedPropertyPrototype = ComputedProperty.prototype;\n\n\n/**\n  Properties are cacheable by default.

The value of this property should be a string representing a path\n  to another object or a custom binding instanced created using Binding helpers\n  (see \"One Way Bindings\"):\n\n  ```\n  valueBinding: \"MyApp.someController.title\"\n  ```\n\n  This will create a binding from `MyApp.someController.title` to the `value`\n  property of your object instance automatically. Now the two values will be\n  kept in sync.\n\n  ## One Way Bindings\n\n  One especially useful binding customization you can use is the `oneWay()`\n  helper. This helper tells Ember that you are only interested in\n  receiving changes on the object you are binding from. For example, if you\n  are binding to a preference and you want to be notified if the preference\n  has changed, but your object will not be changing the preference itself, you\n  could do:\n\n  ```\n  bigTitlesBinding: Ember.Binding.oneWay(\"MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles\")\n  ```\n\n  This way if the value of `MyApp.preferencesController.bigTitles` changes the\n  `bigTitles` property of your object will change also. However, if you\n  change the value of your `bigTitles` property, it will not update the\n  `preferencesController`.\n\n  One way bindings are almost twice as fast to setup and twice as fast to\n  execute because the binding only has to worry about changes to one side.\n\n  You should consider using one way bindings anytime you have an object that\n  may be created frequently and you do not intend to change a property; only\n  to monitor it for changes (such as in the example above).\n\n  ## Adding Bindings Manually\n\n  All of the examples above show you how to configure a custom binding, but the\n  result of these customizations will be a binding template, not a fully active\n  Binding instance. The binding will actually become active only when you\n  instantiate the object the binding belongs to. It is useful however, to\n  understand what actually happens when the binding is activated.\n\n  For a binding to function it must have at least a `from` property and a `to`\n  property. The `from` property path points to the object/key that you want to\n  bind from while the `to` path points to the object/key you want to bind to.\n\n  When you define a custom binding, you are usually describing the property\n  you want to bind from (such as `MyApp.someController.value` in the examples\n  above). When your object is created, it will automatically assign the value\n  you want to bind `to` based on the name of your binding key. In the\n  examples above, during init, Ember objects will effectively call\n  something like this on your binding:\n\n  ```javascript\n  binding = Ember.Binding.from(this.valueBinding).to(\"value\");\n  ```\n\n  This creates a new binding instance based on the template you provide, and\n  sets the to path to the `value` property of the new object. Now that the\n  binding is fully configured with a `from` and a `to`, it simply needs to be\n  connected to become active. This is done through the `connect()` method:\n\n  ```javascript\n  binding.connect(this);\n  ```\n\n  Note that when you connect a binding you pass the object you want it to be\n  connected to. This object will be used as the root for both the from and\n  to side of the binding when inspecting relative paths. This allows the\n  binding to be automatically inherited by subclassed objects as well.\n\n  Now that the binding is connected, it will observe both the from and to side\n  and relay changes.\n\n  If you ever needed to do so (you almost never will, but it is useful to\n  understand this anyway), you could manually create an active binding by\n  using the `Ember.bind()` helper method. (This is the same method used by\n  to setup your bindings on objects):\n\n  ```javascript\n  Ember.bind(MyApp.anotherObject, \"value\", \"MyApp.someController.value\");\n  ```\n\n  Both of these code fragments have the same effect as doing the most friendly\n  form of binding creation like so:\n\n  ```javascript\n  MyApp.anotherObject = Ember.Object.create({\n    valueBinding: \"MyApp.someController.value\",\n\n    // OTHER CODE FOR THIS OBJECT...\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Ember's built in binding creation method makes it easy to automatically\n  create bindings for you. You should always use the highest-level APIs\n  available, even if you understand how it works underneath.\n\n  @class Binding\n  @namespace Ember\n  @since Ember 0.9\n*/\nEmber.Binding = Binding;\n\n\n/**\n  Global helper method to create a new binding.

You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the\n      browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,\n      `denodeify` transforms the following:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var fs = require('fs');\n\n      fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n        if (err) return handleError(err);\n        handleData(data);\n      });\n      ```\n\n      into:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var fs = require('fs');\n\n      var readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n\n      readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);\n      ```\n\n      Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead\n      of using callbacks. For example, instead of:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var fs = require('fs');\n      var log = require('some-async-logger');\n\n      fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n        if (err) return handleError(err);\n        fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){\n          if (err) throw err;\n          log('success', function(err) {\n            if (err) throw err;\n          });\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n\n      You can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var fs = require('fs');\n      var denodeify = RSVP.denodeify;\n      var readFile = denodeify(fs.readFile);\n      var writeFile = denodeify(fs.writeFile);\n      var log = denodeify(require('some-async-logger'));\n\n      readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){\n        return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);\n      }).then(function(){\n        return log('SUCCESS');\n      }).then(function(){\n        // success handler\n      }, function(reason){\n        // rejection handler\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method denodeify\n      @for RSVP\n      @param {Function} nodeFunc a \"node-style\" function that takes a callback as\n      its last argument.

The\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      Terminology\n      -----------\n\n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.  Similarly, a\n      rejection reason is never a thenable.\n\n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n\n\n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n\n      ```js\n      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n\n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n\n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n\n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n\n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error(\"getJSON: `\" + url + \"` failed with status: [\" + this.status + \"]\");\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n\n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @class RSVP.Promise\n      @param {function}\n      @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    function Promise(resolver, label) {\n      if (!isFunction(resolver)) {\n        throw new TypeError('You must pass a resolver function as the first argument to the promise constructor');\n      }\n\n      if (!(this instanceof Promise)) {\n        throw new TypeError(\"Failed to construct 'Promise': Please use the 'new' operator, this object constructor cannot be called as a function.\");\n      }\n\n      this._id = counter++;\n      this._label = label;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      if (config.instrument) {\n        instrument('created', this);\n      }\n\n      if (noop !== resolver) {\n        invokeResolver(resolver, this);\n      }\n    }\n\n    function invokeResolver(resolver, promise) {\n      function resolvePromise(value) {\n        resolve(promise, value);\n      }\n\n      function rejectPromise(reason) {\n        reject(promise, reason);\n      }\n\n      try {\n        resolver(resolvePromise, rejectPromise);\n      } catch(e) {\n        rejectPromise(e);\n      }\n    }\n\n    Promise.cast = cast;\n    Promise.all = all;\n    Promise.race = race;\n    Promise.resolve = Resolve;\n    Promise.reject = Reject;\n\n    var PENDING   = void 0;\n    var SEALED    = 0;\n    var FULFILLED = 1;\n    var REJECTED  = 2;\n\n    function subscribe(parent, child, onFulfillment, onRejection) {\n      var subscribers = parent._subscribers;\n      var length = subscribers.length;\n\n      subscribers[length] = child;\n      subscribers[length + FULFILLED] = onFulfillment;\n      subscribers[length + REJECTED]  = onRejection;\n    }\n\n    function publish(promise, settled) {\n      var child, callback, subscribers = promise._subscribers, detail = promise._detail;\n\n      if (config.instrument) {\n        instrument(settled === FULFILLED ?

This second, \"downstream\"\n      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return user.name;\n      }, function (reason) {\n        return \"default name\";\n      }).then(function (userName) {\n        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n        // will be `\"default name\"`\n      });\n\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new Error(\"Found user, but still unhappy\");\n      }, function (reason) {\n        throw new Error(\"`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy\");\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be \"Found user, but still unhappy\".\n        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be \"`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy\".\n      });\n      ```\n      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new PedagogicalException(\"Upstream error\");\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Assimilation\n      ------------\n\n      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n      retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n      until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // The user's comments are now available\n      });\n      ```\n\n      If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Simple Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var result;\n\n      try {\n        result = findResult();\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n      findResult(function(result, err){\n        if (err) {\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findResult().then(function(result){\n        // success\n      }, function(reason){\n        // failure\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var author, books;\n\n      try {\n        author = findAuthor();\n        books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n\n      function foundBooks(books) {\n\n      }\n\n      function failure(reason) {\n\n      }\n\n      findAuthor(function(author, err){\n        if (err) {\n          failure(err);\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          try {\n            findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n              if (err) {\n                failure(err);\n              } else {\n                try {\n                  foundBooks(books);\n                } catch(reason) {\n                  failure(reason);\n                }\n              }\n            });\n          } catch(error) {\n            failure(err);\n          }\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findAuthor().\n        then(findBooksByAuthor).\n        then(function(books){\n          // found books\n      }).catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method then\n      @param {Function} onFulfilled\n      @param {Function} onRejected\n      @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n      then: function(onFulfillment, onRejection, label) {\n        var promise = this;\n        this._onerror = null;\n\n        var thenPromise = new this.constructor(noop, label);\n\n        if (this._state) {\n          var callbacks = arguments;\n          config.async(function invokePromiseCallback() {\n            invokeCallback(promise._state, thenPromise, callbacks[promise._state - 1], promise._detail);\n          });\n        } else {\n          subscribe(this, thenPromise, onFulfillment, onRejection);\n        }\n\n        if (config.instrument) {\n          instrument('chained', promise, thenPromise);\n        }\n\n        return thenPromise;\n      },\n\n    /**\n      `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n      as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n\n      ```js\n      function findAuthor(){\n        throw new Error(\"couldn't find that author\");\n      }\n\n      // synchronous\n      try {\n        findAuthor();\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // something went wrong\n      }\n\n      // async with promises\n      findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method catch\n      @param {Function} onRejection\n      @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n      'catch': function(onRejection, label) {\n        return this.then(null, onRejection, label);\n      },\n\n    /**\n      `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\n      try/catch/finally behaves\n\n      Synchronous example:\n\n      ```js\n      findAuthor() {\n        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n          throw new Error();\n        }\n        return new Author();\n      }\n\n      try {\n        return findAuthor();

This is one of the fundamental ways that\n  models, controllers and views communicate with each other in an Ember\n  application.\n\n  Any object that has this mixin applied can be used in observer\n  operations. That includes `Ember.Object` and most objects you will\n  interact with as you write your Ember application.\n\n  Note that you will not generally apply this mixin to classes yourself,\n  but you will use the features provided by this module frequently, so it\n  is important to understand how to use it.\n\n  ## Using `get()` and `set()`\n\n  Because of Ember's support for bindings and observers, you will always\n  access properties using the get method, and set properties using the\n  set method. This allows the observing objects to be notified and\n  computed properties to be handled properly.\n\n  More documentation about `get` and `set` are below.\n\n  ## Observing Property Changes\n\n  You typically observe property changes simply by adding the `observes`\n  call to the end of your method declarations in classes that you write.\n  For example:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Ember.Object.extend({\n    valueObserver: function() {\n      // Executes whenever the \"value\" property changes\n    }.observes('value')\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Although this is the most common way to add an observer, this capability\n  is actually built into the `Ember.Object` class on top of two methods\n  defined in this mixin: `addObserver` and `removeObserver`. You can use\n  these two methods to add and remove observers yourself if you need to\n  do so at runtime.\n\n  To add an observer for a property, call:\n\n  ```javascript\n  object.addObserver('propertyKey', targetObject, targetAction)\n  ```\n\n  This will call the `targetAction` method on the `targetObject` whenever\n  the value of the `propertyKey` changes.\n\n  Note that if `propertyKey` is a computed property, the observer will be\n  called when any of the property dependencies are changed, even if the\n  resulting value of the computed property is unchanged. This is necessary\n  because computed properties are not computed until `get` is called.\n\n  @class Observable\n  @namespace Ember\n*/\nEmber.Observable = Ember.Mixin.create({\n\n  /**\n    Retrieves the value of a property from the object.\n\n    This method is usually similar to using `object[keyName]` or `object.keyName`,\n    however it supports both computed properties and the unknownProperty\n    handler.\n\n    Because `get` unifies the syntax for accessing all these kinds\n    of properties, it can make many refactorings easier, such as replacing a\n    simple property with a computed property, or vice versa.\n\n    ### Computed Properties\n\n    Computed properties are methods defined with the `property` modifier\n    declared at the end, such as:\n\n    ```javascript\n    fullName: function() {\n      return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');\n    }.property('firstName', 'lastName')\n    ```\n\n    When you call `get` on a computed property, the function will be\n    called and the return value will be returned instead of the function\n    itself.\n\n    ### Unknown Properties\n\n    Likewise, if you try to call `get` on a property whose value is\n    `undefined`, the `unknownProperty()` method will be called on the object.\n    If this method returns any value other than `undefined`, it will be returned\n    instead. This allows you to implement \"virtual\" properties that are\n    not defined upfront.\n\n    @method get\n    @param {String} keyName The property to retrieve\n    @return {Object} The property value or undefined.\n  */\n  get: function(keyName) {\n    return get(this, keyName);\n  },\n\n  /**\n    To get multiple properties at once, call `getProperties`\n    with a list of strings or an array:\n\n    ```javascript\n    record.getProperties('firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode');  // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }\n    ```\n\n    is equivalent to:\n\n    ```javascript\n    record.getProperties(['firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode']);  // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }\n    ```\n\n    @method getProperties\n    @param {String...|Array} list of keys to get\n    @return {Hash}\n  */\n  getProperties: function() {\n    return getProperties.apply(null, [this].concat(slice.call(arguments)));\n  },\n\n  /**\n    Sets the provided key or path to the value.\n\n    This method is generally very similar to calling `object[key] = value` or\n    `object.key = value`, except that it provides support for computed\n    properties, the `setUnknownProperty()` method and property observers.\n\n    ### Computed Properties\n\n    If you try to set a value on a key that has a computed property handler\n    defined (see the `get()` method for an example), then `set()` will call\n    that method, passing both the value and key instead of simply changing\n    the value itself. This is useful for those times when you need to\n    implement a property that is composed of one or more member\n    properties.\n\n    ### Unknown Properties\n\n    If you try to set a value on a key that is undefined in the target\n    object, then the `setUnknownProperty()` handler will be called instead. This\n    gives you an opportunity to implement complex \"virtual\" properties that\n    are not predefined on the object. If `setUnknownProperty()` returns\n    undefined, then `set()` will simply set the value on the object.\n\n    ### Property Observers\n\n    In addition to changing the property, `set()` will also register a property\n    change with the object. Unless you have placed this call inside of a\n    `beginPropertyChanges()` and `endPropertyChanges(),` any \"local\" observers\n    (i.e. observer methods declared on the same object), will be called\n    immediately. Any \"remote\" observers (i.e. observer methods declared on\n    another object) will be placed in a queue and called at a later time in a\n    coalesced manner.\n\n    ### Chaining\n\n    In addition to property changes, `set()` returns the value of the object\n    itself so you can do chaining like this:\n\n    ```javascript\n    record.set('firstName', 'Charles').set('lastName', 'Jolley');\n    ```\n\n    @method set\n    @param {String} keyName The property to set\n    @param {Object} value The value to set or `null`.\n    @return {Ember.Observable}\n  */\n  set: function(keyName, value) {\n    set(this, keyName, value);\n    return this;\n  },\n\n\n  /**\n    Sets a list of properties at once.

However, there are some cases where it is preferable\n    to build up a property's value by combining the superclass' property\n    value with the subclass' value. An example of this in use within Ember\n    is the `classNames` property of `Ember.View`.\n\n    Here is some sample code showing the difference between a concatenated\n    property and a normal one:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.BarView = Ember.View.extend({\n      someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['bar'],\n      classNames: ['bar']\n    });\n\n    App.FooBarView = App.BarView.extend({\n      someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['foo'],\n      classNames: ['foo'],\n    });\n\n    var fooBarView = App.FooBarView.create();\n    fooBarView.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['foo']\n    fooBarView.get('classNames'); // ['ember-view', 'bar', 'foo']\n    ```\n\n    This behavior extends to object creation as well. Continuing the\n    above example:\n\n    ```javascript\n    var view = App.FooBarView.create({\n      someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['baz'],\n      classNames: ['baz']\n    })\n    view.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['baz']\n    view.get('classNames'); // ['ember-view', 'bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n    ```\n    Adding a single property that is not an array will just add it in the array:\n\n    ```javascript\n    var view = App.FooBarView.create({\n      classNames: 'baz'\n    })\n    view.get('classNames'); // ['ember-view', 'bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n    ```\n\n    Using the `concatenatedProperties` property, we can tell to Ember that mix\n    the content of the properties.\n\n    In `Ember.View` the `classNameBindings` and `attributeBindings` properties\n    are also concatenated, in addition to `classNames`.\n\n    This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,\n    although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently. Since\n    it changes expectations about behavior of properties, you should properly\n    document its usage in each individual concatenated property (to not\n    mislead your users to think they can override the property in a subclass).\n\n    @property concatenatedProperties\n    @type Array\n    @default null\n  */\n  concatenatedProperties: null,\n\n  /**\n    Destroyed object property flag.\n\n    if this property is `true` the observers and bindings were already\n    removed by the effect of calling the `destroy()` method.\n\n    @property isDestroyed\n    @default false\n  */\n  isDestroyed: false,\n\n  /**\n    Destruction scheduled flag.

The `extend()` on line #8 creates a *subclass* of `App.Person`. Any instance of the `App.Person` class will *not* have the `march()` method.\n\n    You can also pass `Ember.Mixin` classes to add additional properties to the subclass.\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.Person = Ember.Object.extend({\n      say: function(thing) {\n        alert(this.get('name') + ' says: ' + thing);\n      }\n    });\n\n    App.SingingMixin = Ember.Mixin.create({\n      sing: function(thing){\n        alert(this.get('name') + ' sings: la la la ' + thing);\n      }\n    });\n\n    App.BroadwayStar = App.Person.extend(App.SingingMixin, {\n      dance: function() {\n        alert(this.get('name') + ' dances: tap tap tap tap ');\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    The `App.BroadwayStar` class contains three methods: `say()`, `sing()`, and `dance()`.\n\n    @method extend\n    @static\n\n    @param {Ember.Mixin} [mixins]* One or more Ember.Mixin classes\n    @param {Object} [arguments]* Object containing values to use within the new class\n  */\n  extend: function() {\n    var Class = makeCtor(), proto;\n    Class.ClassMixin = Mixin.create(this.ClassMixin);\n    Class.PrototypeMixin = Mixin.create(this.PrototypeMixin);\n\n    Class.ClassMixin.ownerConstructor = Class;\n    Class.PrototypeMixin.ownerConstructor = Class;\n\n    reopen.apply(Class.PrototypeMixin, arguments);\n\n    Class.superclass = this;\n    Class.__super__  = this.prototype;\n\n    proto = Class.prototype = o_create(this.prototype);\n    proto.constructor = Class;\n    generateGuid(proto);\n    meta(proto).proto = proto; // this will disable observers on prototype\n\n    Class.ClassMixin.apply(Class);\n    return Class;\n  },\n\n  /**\n    Equivalent to doing `extend(arguments).create()`.\n    If possible use the normal `create` method instead.\n\n    @method createWithMixins\n    @static\n    @param [arguments]*\n  */\n  createWithMixins: function() {\n    var C = this;\n    if (arguments.length>0) { this._initMixins(arguments); }\n    return new C();\n  },\n\n  /**\n    Creates an instance of a class.

If Array already implements\n  one of these methods, the mixin will not override them.\n\n  ## Writing Your Own Enumerable\n\n  To make your own custom class enumerable, you need two items:\n\n  1. You must have a length property. This property should change whenever\n     the number of items in your enumerable object changes. If you use this\n     with an `Ember.Object` subclass, you should be sure to change the length\n     property using `set().`\n\n  2. You must implement `nextObject().` See documentation.\n\n  Once you have these two methods implemented, apply the `Ember.Enumerable` mixin\n  to your class and you will be able to enumerate the contents of your object\n  like any other collection.\n\n  ## Using Ember Enumeration with Other Libraries\n\n  Many other libraries provide some kind of iterator or enumeration like\n  facility. This is often where the most common API conflicts occur.\n  Ember's API is designed to be as friendly as possible with other\n  libraries by implementing only methods that mostly correspond to the\n  JavaScript 1.8 API.\n\n  @class Enumerable\n  @namespace Ember\n  @since Ember 0.9\n*/\nEmber.Enumerable = Ember.Mixin.create({\n\n  /**\n    Implement this method to make your class enumerable.\n\n    This method will be call repeatedly during enumeration.

This is a useful way to\n    manage iteration if you are tracing a linked list, for example.\n\n    Finally the context parameter will always contain a hash you can use as\n    a \"scratchpad\" to maintain any other state you need in order to iterate\n    properly. The context object is reused and is not reset between\n    iterations so make sure you setup the context with a fresh state whenever\n    the index parameter is 0.\n\n    Generally iterators will continue to call `nextObject` until the index\n    reaches the your current length-1.

This mixin is\n  picked up by the Array class as well as other controllers, etc. that want to\n  appear to be arrays.\n\n  Unlike `Ember.Enumerable,` this mixin defines methods specifically for\n  collections that provide index-ordered access to their contents. When you\n  are designing code that needs to accept any kind of Array-like object, you\n  should use these methods instead of Array primitives because these will\n  properly notify observers of changes to the array.\n\n  Although these methods are efficient, they do add a layer of indirection to\n  your application so it is a good idea to use them only when you need the\n  flexibility of using both true JavaScript arrays and \"virtual\" arrays such\n  as controllers and collections.\n\n  You can use the methods defined in this module to access and modify array\n  contents in a KVO-friendly way. You can also be notified whenever the\n  membership of an array changes by changing the syntax of the property to\n  `.observes('*myProperty.[]')`.\n\n  To support `Ember.Array` in your own class, you must override two\n  primitives to use it: `replace()` and `objectAt()`.\n\n  Note that the Ember.Array mixin also incorporates the `Ember.Enumerable`\n  mixin.

When items are added or\n  removed from the dependent array(s) a reduce computed only operates\n  on the change instead of re-evaluating the entire array.\n\n  If there are more than one arguments the first arguments are\n  considered to be dependent property keys. The last argument is\n  required to be an options object. The options object can have the\n  following four properties:\n\n  `initialValue` - A value or function that will be used as the initial\n  value for the computed. If this property is a function the result of calling\n  the function will be used as the initial value. This property is required.\n\n  `initialize` - An optional initialize function. Typically this will be used\n  to set up state on the instanceMeta object.\n\n  `removedItem` - A function that is called each time an element is removed\n  from the array.\n\n  `addedItem` - A function that is called each time an element is added to\n  the array.\n\n\n  The `initialize` function has the following signature:\n\n  ```javascript\n   function (initialValue, changeMeta, instanceMeta)\n  ```\n\n  `initialValue` - The value of the `initialValue` property from the\n  options object.\n\n  `changeMeta` - An object which contains meta information about the\n  computed. It contains the following properties:\n\n     - `property` the computed property\n     - `propertyName` the name of the property on the object\n\n  `instanceMeta` - An object that can be used to store meta\n  information needed for calculating your computed. For example a\n  unique computed might use this to store the number of times a given\n  element is found in the dependent array.\n\n\n  The `removedItem` and `addedItem` functions both have the following signature:\n\n  ```javascript\n  function (accumulatedValue, item, changeMeta, instanceMeta)\n  ```\n\n  `accumulatedValue` - The value returned from the last time\n  `removedItem` or `addedItem` was called or `initialValue`.\n\n  `item` - the element added or removed from the array\n\n  `changeMeta` - An object which contains meta information about the\n  change. It contains the following properties:\n\n    - `property` the computed property\n    - `propertyName` the name of the property on the object\n    - `index` the index of the added or removed item\n    - `item` the added or removed item: this is exactly the same as\n      the second arg\n    - `arrayChanged` the array that triggered the change. Can be\n      useful when depending on multiple arrays.\n\n  For property changes triggered on an item property change (when\n  depKey is something like `someArray.@each.someProperty`),\n  `changeMeta` will also contain the following property:\n\n    - `previousValues` an object whose keys are the properties that changed on\n    the item, and whose values are the item's previous values.\n\n  `previousValues` is important Ember coalesces item property changes via\n  Ember.run.once. This means that by the time removedItem gets called, item has\n  the new values, but you may need the previous value (eg for sorting &\n  filtering).\n\n  `instanceMeta` - An object that can be used to store meta\n  information needed for calculating your computed. For example a\n  unique computed might use this to store the number of times a given\n  element is found in the dependent array.\n\n  The `removedItem` and `addedItem` functions should return the accumulated\n  value. It is acceptable to not return anything (ie return undefined)\n  to invalidate the computation. This is generally not a good idea for\n  arrayComputed but it's used in eg max and min.\n\n  Note that observers will be fired if either of these functions return a value\n  that differs from the accumulated value.  When returning an object that\n  mutates in response to array changes, for example an array that maps\n  everything from some other array (see `Ember.computed.map`), it is usually\n  important that the *same* array be returned to avoid accidentally triggering observers.\n\n  Example\n\n  ```javascript\n  Ember.computed.max = function (dependentKey) {\n    return Ember.reduceComputed(dependentKey, {\n      initialValue: -Infinity,\n\n      addedItem: function (accumulatedValue, item, changeMeta, instanceMeta) {\n        return Math.max(accumulatedValue, item);\n      },\n\n      removedItem: function (accumulatedValue, item, changeMeta, instanceMeta) {\n        if (item < accumulatedValue) {\n          return accumulatedValue;\n        }\n      }\n    });\n  };\n  ```\n\n  Dependent keys may refer to `@this` to observe changes to the object itself,\n  which must be array-like, rather than a property of the object.  This is\n  mostly useful for array proxies, to ensure objects are retrieved via\n  `objectAtContent`.  This is how you could sort items by properties defined on an item controller.\n\n  Example\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.PeopleController = Ember.ArrayController.extend({\n    itemController: 'person',\n\n    sortedPeople: Ember.computed.sort('@this.@each.reversedName', function(personA, personB) {\n      // `reversedName` isn't defined on Person, but we have access to it via\n      // the item controller App.PersonController.  If we'd used\n      // `content.@each.reversedName` above, we would be getting the objects\n      // directly and not have access to `reversedName`.\n      //\n      var reversedNameA = get(personA, 'reversedName'),\n          reversedNameB = get(personB, 'reversedName');\n\n      return Ember.compare(reversedNameA, reversedNameB);\n    })\n  });\n\n  App.PersonController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({\n    reversedName: function () {\n      return reverse(get(this, 'name'));\n    }.property('name')\n  })\n  ```\n\n  Dependent keys whose values are not arrays are treated as regular\n  dependencies: when they change, the computed property is completely\n  recalculated.  It is sometimes useful to have dependent arrays with similar\n  semantics.  Dependent keys which end in `.[]` do not use \"one at a time\"\n  semantics.  When an item is added or removed from such a dependency, the\n  computed property is completely recomputed.\n\n  Example\n\n  ```javascript\n  Ember.Object.extend({\n    // When `string` is changed, `computed` is completely recomputed.\n    string: 'a string',\n\n    // When an item is added to `array`, `addedItem` is called.\n    array: [],\n\n    // When an item is added to `anotherArray`, `computed` is completely\n    // recomputed.\n    anotherArray: [],\n\n    computed: Ember.reduceComputed('string', 'array', 'anotherArray.[]', {\n      addedItem: addedItemCallback,\n      removedItem: removedItemCallback\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method reduceComputed\n  @for Ember\n  @param {String} [dependentKeys*]\n  @param {Object} options\n  @return {Ember.ComputedProperty}\n*/\nEmber.reduceComputed = function (options) {\n  var args;\n\n  if (arguments.length > 1) {\n    args = a_slice.call(arguments, 0, -1);\n    options = a_slice.call(arguments, -1)[0];\n  }\n\n  if (typeof options !== \"object\") {\n    throw new Ember.Error(\"Reduce Computed Property declared without an options hash\");\n  }\n\n  if (!('initialValue' in options)) {\n    throw new Ember.Error(\"Reduce Computed Property declared without an initial value\");\n  }\n\n  var cp = new ReduceComputedProperty(options);\n\n  if (args) {\n    cp.property.apply(cp, args);\n  }\n\n  return cp;\n};\n\n})();\n\n\n\n(function() {\nvar ReduceComputedProperty = Ember.ReduceComputedProperty,\n    a_slice = [].slice,\n    o_create = Ember.create,\n    forEach = Ember.EnumerableUtils.forEach;\n\nfunction ArrayComputedProperty() {\n  var cp = this;\n\n  ReduceComputedProperty.apply(this, arguments);\n\n  this.func = (function(reduceFunc) {\n    return function (propertyName) {\n      if (!cp._hasInstanceMeta(this, propertyName)) {\n        // When we recompute an array computed property, we need already\n        // retrieved arrays to be updated; we can't simply empty the cache and\n        // hope the array is re-retrieved.\n        forEach(cp._dependentKeys, function(dependentKey) {\n          Ember.addObserver(this, dependentKey, function() {\n            cp.recomputeOnce.call(this, propertyName);\n          });\n        }, this);\n      }\n\n      return reduceFunc.apply(this, arguments);\n    };\n  })(this.func);\n\n  return this;\n}\nEmber.ArrayComputedProperty = ArrayComputedProperty;\nArrayComputedProperty.prototype = o_create(ReduceComputedProperty.prototype);\nArrayComputedProperty.prototype.initialValue = function () {\n  return Ember.A();\n};\nArrayComputedProperty.prototype.resetValue = function (array) {\n  array.clear();\n  return array;\n};\n\n// This is a stopgap to keep the reference counts correct with lazy CPs.\nArrayComputedProperty.prototype.didChange = function (obj, keyName) {\n  return;\n};\n\n/**\n  Creates a computed property which operates on dependent arrays and\n  is updated with \"one at a time\" semantics. When items are added or\n  removed from the dependent array(s) an array computed only operates\n  on the change instead of re-evaluating the entire array. This should\n  return an array, if you'd like to use \"one at a time\" semantics and\n  compute some value other then an array look at\n  `Ember.reduceComputed`.\n\n  If there are more than one arguments the first arguments are\n  considered to be dependent property keys. The last argument is\n  required to be an options object. The options object can have the\n  following three properties.\n\n  `initialize` - An optional initialize function. Typically this will be used\n  to set up state on the instanceMeta object.\n\n  `removedItem` - A function that is called each time an element is\n  removed from the array.\n\n  `addedItem` - A function that is called each time an element is\n  added to the array.\n\n\n  The `initialize` function has the following signature:\n\n  ```javascript\n   function (array, changeMeta, instanceMeta)\n  ```\n\n  `array` - The initial value of the arrayComputed, an empty array.\n\n  `changeMeta` - An object which contains meta information about the\n  computed. It contains the following properties:\n\n     - `property` the computed property\n     - `propertyName` the name of the property on the object\n\n  `instanceMeta` - An object that can be used to store meta\n  information needed for calculating your computed. For example a\n  unique computed might use this to store the number of times a given\n  element is found in the dependent array.\n\n\n  The `removedItem` and `addedItem` functions both have the following signature:\n\n  ```javascript\n  function (accumulatedValue, item, changeMeta, instanceMeta)\n  ```\n\n  `accumulatedValue` - The value returned from the last time\n  `removedItem` or `addedItem` was called or an empty array.\n\n  `item` - the element added or removed from the array\n\n  `changeMeta` - An object which contains meta information about the\n  change. It contains the following properties:\n\n    - `property` the computed property\n    - `propertyName` the name of the property on the object\n    - `index` the index of the added or removed item\n    - `item` the added or removed item: this is exactly the same as\n      the second arg\n    - `arrayChanged` the array that triggered the change. Can be\n      useful when depending on multiple arrays.\n\n  For property changes triggered on an item property change (when\n  depKey is something like `someArray.@each.someProperty`),\n  `changeMeta` will also contain the following property:\n\n    - `previousValues` an object whose keys are the properties that changed on\n    the item, and whose values are the item's previous values.\n\n  `previousValues` is important Ember coalesces item property changes via\n  Ember.run.once. This means that by the time removedItem gets called, item has\n  the new values, but you may need the previous value (eg for sorting &\n  filtering).\n\n  `instanceMeta` - An object that can be used to store meta\n  information needed for calculating your computed. For example a\n  unique computed might use this to store the number of times a given\n  element is found in the dependent array.\n\n  The `removedItem` and `addedItem` functions should return the accumulated\n  value. It is acceptable to not return anything (ie return undefined)\n  to invalidate the computation. This is generally not a good idea for\n  arrayComputed but it's used in eg max and min.\n\n  Example\n\n  ```javascript\n  Ember.computed.map = function(dependentKey, callback) {\n    var options = {\n      addedItem: function(array, item, changeMeta, instanceMeta) {\n        var mapped = callback(item);\n        array.insertAt(changeMeta.index, mapped);\n        return array;\n      },\n      removedItem: function(array, item, changeMeta, instanceMeta) {\n        array.removeAt(changeMeta.index, 1);\n        return array;\n      }\n    };\n\n    return Ember.arrayComputed(dependentKey, options);\n  };\n  ```\n\n  @method arrayComputed\n  @for Ember\n  @param {String} [dependentKeys*]\n  @param {Object} options\n  @return {Ember.ComputedProperty}\n*/\nEmber.arrayComputed = function (options) {\n  var args;\n\n  if (arguments.length > 1) {\n    args = a_slice.call(arguments, 0, -1);\n    options = a_slice.call(arguments, -1)[0];\n  }\n\n  if (typeof options !== \"object\") {\n    throw new Ember.Error(\"Array Computed Property declared without an options hash\");\n  }\n\n  var cp = new ArrayComputedProperty(options);\n\n  if (args) {\n    cp.property.apply(cp, args);\n  }\n\n  return cp;\n};\n\n})();\n\n\n\n(function() {\n/**\n@module ember\n@submodule ember-runtime\n*/\n\nvar get = Ember.get,\n    set = Ember.set,\n    guidFor = Ember.guidFor,\n    merge = Ember.merge,\n    a_slice = [].slice,\n    forEach = Ember.EnumerableUtils.forEach,\n    map = Ember.EnumerableUtils.map,\n    SearchProxy;\n\n/**\n A computed property that returns the sum of the value\n in the dependent array.\n\n @method computed.sum\n @for Ember\n @param {String} dependentKey\n @return {Ember.ComputedProperty} computes the sum of all values in the dependentKey's array\n*/\n\nEmber.computed.sum = function(dependentKey){\n  return Ember.reduceComputed(dependentKey, {\n    initialValue: 0,\n\n    addedItem: function(accumulatedValue, item, changeMeta, instanceMeta){\n      return accumulatedValue + item;\n    },\n\n    removedItem: function(accumulatedValue, item, changeMeta, instanceMeta){\n      return accumulatedValue - item;\n    }\n  });\n};\n\n/**\n  A computed property that calculates the maximum value in the\n  dependent array.

Once an object is frozen it should be read only. No changes\n  may be made the internal state of the object.\n\n  ## Enforcement\n\n  To fully support freezing in your subclass, you must include this mixin and\n  override any method that might alter any property on the object to instead\n  raise an exception. You can check the state of an object by checking the\n  `isFrozen` property.\n\n  Although future versions of JavaScript may support language-level freezing\n  object objects, that is not the case today. Even if an object is freezable,\n  it is still technically possible to modify the object, even though it could\n  break other parts of your application that do not expect a frozen object to\n  change. It is, therefore, very important that you always respect the\n  `isFrozen` property on all freezable objects.\n\n  ## Example Usage\n\n  The example below shows a simple object that implement the `Ember.Freezable`\n  protocol.\n\n  ```javascript\n  Contact = Ember.Object.extend(Ember.Freezable, {\n    firstName: null,\n    lastName: null,\n\n    // swaps the names\n    swapNames: function() {\n      if (this.get('isFrozen')) throw Ember.FROZEN_ERROR;\n      var tmp = this.get('firstName');\n      this.set('firstName', this.get('lastName'));\n      this.set('lastName', tmp);\n      return this;\n    }\n\n  });\n\n  c = Contact.create({ firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Doe\" });\n  c.swapNames();  // returns c\n  c.freeze();\n  c.swapNames();  // EXCEPTION\n  ```\n\n  ## Copying\n\n  Usually the `Ember.Freezable` protocol is implemented in cooperation with the\n  `Ember.Copyable` protocol, which defines a `frozenCopy()` method that will\n  return a frozen object, if the object implements this method as well.\n\n  @class Freezable\n  @namespace Ember\n  @since Ember 0.9\n*/\nEmber.Freezable = Ember.Mixin.create({\n\n  /**\n    Set to `true` when the object is frozen.

This\n  method will only add the object to the enumerable if the object is not\n  already present and is of a type supported by the enumerable.\n\n  ```javascript\n  set.addObject(contact);\n  ```\n\n  ## Removing Objects\n\n  To remove an object from an enumerable, use the `removeObject()` method.

You\n  can create a set to efficiently test for membership for an object. You can\n  also iterate through a set just like an array, even accessing objects by\n  index, however there is no guarantee as to their order.\n\n  All Sets are observable via the Enumerable Observer API - which works\n  on any enumerable object including both Sets and Arrays.\n\n  ## Creating a Set\n\n  You can create a set like you would most objects using\n  `new Ember.Set()`. Most new sets you create will be empty, but you can\n  also initialize the set with some content by passing an array or other\n  enumerable of objects to the constructor.\n\n  Finally, you can pass in an existing set and the set will be copied. You\n  can also create a copy of a set by calling `Ember.Set#copy()`.\n\n  ```javascript\n  // creates a new empty set\n  var foundNames = new Ember.Set();\n\n  // creates a set with four names in it.\n  var names = new Ember.Set([\"Charles\", \"Tom\", \"Juan\", \"Alex\"]); // :P\n\n  // creates a copy of the names set.\n  var namesCopy = new Ember.Set(names);\n\n  // same as above.\n  var anotherNamesCopy = names.copy();\n  ```\n\n  ## Adding/Removing Objects\n\n  You generally add or remove objects from a set using `add()` or\n  `remove()`. You can add any type of object including primitives such as\n  numbers, strings, and booleans.\n\n  Unlike arrays, objects can only exist one time in a set. If you call `add()`\n  on a set with the same object multiple times, the object will only be added\n  once. Likewise, calling `remove()` with the same object multiple times will\n  remove the object the first time and have no effect on future calls until\n  you add the object to the set again.\n\n  NOTE: You cannot add/remove `null` or `undefined` to a set. Any attempt to do\n  so will be ignored.\n\n  In addition to add/remove you can also call `push()`/`pop()`. Push behaves\n  just like `add()` but `pop()`, unlike `remove()` will pick an arbitrary\n  object, remove it and return it. This is a good way to use a set as a job\n  queue when you don't care which order the jobs are executed in.\n\n  ## Testing for an Object\n\n  To test for an object's presence in a set you simply call\n  `Ember.Set#contains()`.\n\n  ## Observing changes\n\n  When using `Ember.Set`, you can observe the `\"[]\"` property to be\n  alerted whenever the content changes. You can also add an enumerable\n  observer to the set to be notified of specific objects that are added and\n  removed from the set. See [Ember.Enumerable](/api/classes/Ember.Enumerable.html)\n  for more information on enumerables.\n\n  This is often unhelpful. If you are filtering sets of objects, for instance,\n  it is very inefficient to re-filter all of the items each time the set\n  changes. It would be better if you could just adjust the filtered set based\n  on what was changed on the original set. The same issue applies to merging\n  sets, as well.\n\n  ## Other Methods\n\n  `Ember.Set` primary implements other mixin APIs. For a complete reference\n  on the methods you will use with `Ember.Set`, please consult these mixins.\n  The most useful ones will be `Ember.Enumerable` and\n  `Ember.MutableEnumerable` which implement most of the common iterator\n  methods you are used to on Array.\n\n  Note that you can also use the `Ember.Copyable` and `Ember.Freezable`\n  APIs on `Ember.Set` as well. Once a set is frozen it can no longer be\n  modified. The benefit of this is that when you call `frozenCopy()` on it,\n  Ember will avoid making copies of the set. This allows you to write\n  code that can know with certainty when the underlying set data will or\n  will not be modified.\n\n  @class Set\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.CoreObject\n  @uses Ember.MutableEnumerable\n  @uses Ember.Copyable\n  @uses Ember.Freezable\n  @since Ember 0.9\n*/\nEmber.Set = Ember.CoreObject.extend(Ember.MutableEnumerable, Ember.Copyable, Ember.Freezable,\n  {\n\n  // ..........................................................\n  // IMPLEMENT ENUMERABLE APIS\n  //\n\n  /**\n    This property will change as the number of objects in the set changes.\n\n    @property length\n    @type number\n    @default 0\n  */\n  length: 0,\n\n  /**\n    Clears the set.

`Ember.ArrayController` provides a way for you to publish a collection of\n  objects so that you can easily bind to the collection from a Handlebars\n  `#each` helper, an `Ember.CollectionView`, or other controllers.\n\n  The advantage of using an `ArrayController` is that you only have to set up\n  your view bindings once; to change what's displayed, simply swap out the\n  `content` property on the controller.\n\n  For example, imagine you wanted to display a list of items fetched via an XHR\n  request. Create an `Ember.ArrayController` and set its `content` property:\n\n  ```javascript\n  MyApp.listController = Ember.ArrayController.create();\n\n  $.get('people.json', function(data) {\n    MyApp.listController.set('content', data);\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Then, create a view that binds to your new controller:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{#each MyApp.listController}}\n    {{firstName}} {{lastName}}\n  {{/each}}\n  ```\n\n  Although you are binding to the controller, the behavior of this controller\n  is to pass through any methods or properties to the underlying array. This\n  capability comes from `Ember.ArrayProxy`, which this class inherits from.\n\n  Sometimes you want to display computed properties within the body of an\n  `#each` helper that depend on the underlying items in `content`, but are not\n  present on those items.   To do this, set `itemController` to the name of a\n  controller (probably an `ObjectController`) that will wrap each individual item.\n\n  For example:\n\n  ```handlebars\n    {{#each post in controller}}\n      <li>{{title}} ({{titleLength}} characters)</li>\n    {{/each}}\n  ```\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.PostsController = Ember.ArrayController.extend({\n    itemController: 'post'\n  });\n\n  App.PostController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({\n    // the `title` property will be proxied to the underlying post.\n\n    titleLength: function() {\n      return this.get('title').length;\n    }.property('title')\n  });\n  ```\n\n  In some cases it is helpful to return a different `itemController` depending\n  on the particular item.  Subclasses can do this by overriding\n  `lookupItemController`.\n\n  For example:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.MyArrayController = Ember.ArrayController.extend({\n    lookupItemController: function( object ) {\n      if (object.get('isSpecial')) {\n        return \"special\"; // use App.SpecialController\n      } else {\n        return \"regular\"; // use App.RegularController\n      }\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  The itemController instances will have a `parentController` property set to\n  the `ArrayController` instance.\n\n  @class ArrayController\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.ArrayProxy\n  @uses Ember.SortableMixin\n  @uses Ember.ControllerMixin\n*/\n\nEmber.ArrayController = Ember.ArrayProxy.extend(Ember.ControllerMixin,\n  Ember.SortableMixin, {\n\n  /**\n    The controller used to wrap items, if any.\n\n    @property itemController\n    @type String\n    @default null\n  */\n  itemController: null,\n\n  /**\n    Return the name of the controller to wrap items, or `null` if items should\n    be returned directly.

The following view\n  class:\n\n  ```javascript\n  ParagraphView = Ember.View.extend({\n    tagName: 'em'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Would result in instances with the following HTML:\n\n  ```html\n  <em id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></em>\n  ```\n\n  ## HTML `class` Attribute\n\n  The HTML `class` attribute of a view's tag can be set by providing a\n  `classNames` property that is set to an array of strings:\n\n  ```javascript\n  MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNames: ['my-class', 'my-other-class']\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view my-class my-other-class\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings`\n  property set to an array of properties names for the view. The return value\n  of these properties will be added as part of the value for the view's `class`\n  attribute. These properties can be computed properties:\n\n  ```javascript\n  MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['propertyA', 'propertyB'],\n    propertyA: 'from-a',\n    propertyB: function() {\n      if (someLogic) { return 'from-b'; }\n    }.property()\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view from-a from-b\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name\n  itself will be used as the class name if the property is true. The class name\n  will not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.\n\n  ```javascript\n  MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['hovered'],\n    hovered: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view hovered\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other\n  than the property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the\n  preferred value after a \":\" character when defining the binding:\n\n  ```javascript\n  MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['awesome:so-very-cool'],\n    awesome: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view so-very-cool\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a\n  camelCase-style format will be converted to a dasherized format:\n\n  ```javascript\n  MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],\n    isUrgent: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view is-urgent\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by\n  traversing a path relative to the view itself:\n\n  ```javascript\n  MyView = Ember.View.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['messages.empty']\n    messages: Ember.Object.create({\n      empty: true\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view empty\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and\n  and a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding\n  like this:\n\n  ```javascript\n  // Applies 'enabled' class when isEnabled is true and 'disabled' when isEnabled is false\n  Ember.View.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled']\n    isEnabled: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view enabled\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML reprensentation looks like\n  this:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:\n\n  ```javascript\n  // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false\n  Ember.View.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled']\n    isEnabled: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  When the `isEnabled` property on the view is set to `false`, it will result\n  in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  Updates to the the value of a class name binding will result in automatic\n  update of the  HTML `class` attribute in the view's rendered HTML\n  representation. If the value becomes `false` or `undefined` the class name\n  will be removed.\n\n  Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties. See\n  [Ember.Object](/api/classes/Ember.Object.html) documentation for more\n  information about concatenated properties.\n\n  ## HTML Attributes\n\n  The HTML attribute section of a view's tag can be set by providing an\n  `attributeBindings` property set to an array of property names on the view.\n  The return value of these properties will be used as the value of the view's\n  HTML associated attribute:\n\n  ```javascript\n  AnchorView = Ember.View.extend({\n    tagName: 'a',\n    attributeBindings: ['href'],\n    href: 'http://google.com'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n  ```\n\n  If the return value of an `attributeBindings` monitored property is a boolean\n  the property will follow HTML's pattern of repeating the attribute's name as\n  its value:\n\n  ```javascript\n  MyTextInput = Ember.View.extend({\n    tagName: 'input',\n    attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n    disabled: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <input id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" disabled=\"disabled\" />\n  ```\n\n  `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:\n\n  ```javascript\n  MyTextInput = Ember.View.extend({\n    tagName: 'input',\n    attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n    disabled: function() {\n      if (someLogic) {\n        return true;\n      } else {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }.property()\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Updates to the the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic\n  update of the  HTML attribute in the view's rendered HTML representation.\n\n  `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See [Ember.Object](/api/classes/Ember.Object.html)\n  documentation for more information about concatenated properties.\n\n  ## Templates\n\n  The HTML contents of a view's rendered representation are determined by its\n  template. Templates can be any function that accepts an optional context\n  parameter and returns a string of HTML that will be inserted within the\n  view's tag. Most typically in Ember this function will be a compiled\n  `Ember.Handlebars` template.\n\n  ```javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('I am the template')\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">I am the template</div>\n  ```\n\n  Within an Ember application is more common to define a Handlebars templates as\n  part of a page:\n\n  ```html\n  <script type='text/x-handlebars' data-template-name='some-template'>\n    Hello\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  And associate it by name using a view's `templateName` property:\n\n  ```javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    templateName: 'some-template'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  If you have nested resources, your Handlebars template will look like this:\n\n  ```html\n  <script type='text/x-handlebars' data-template-name='posts/new'>\n    <h1>New Post</h1>\n  </script>\n  ```\n\n  And `templateName` property:\n\n  ```javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    templateName: 'posts/new'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Using a value for `templateName` that does not have a Handlebars template\n  with a matching `data-template-name` attribute will throw an error.\n\n  For views classes that may have a template later defined (e.g. as the block\n  portion of a `{{view}}` Handlebars helper call in another template or in\n  a subclass), you can provide a `defaultTemplate` property set to compiled\n  template function. If a template is not later provided for the view instance\n  the `defaultTemplate` value will be used:\n\n  ```javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    defaultTemplate: Ember.Handlebars.compile('I was the default'),\n    template: null,\n    templateName: null\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">I was the default</div>\n  ```\n\n  If a `template` or `templateName` is provided it will take precedence over\n  `defaultTemplate`:\n\n  ```javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    defaultTemplate: Ember.Handlebars.compile('I was the default')\n  });\n\n  aView = AView.create({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('I was the template, not default')\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the following HTML representation when rendered:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">I was the template, not default</div>\n  ```\n\n  ## View Context\n\n  The default context of the compiled template is the view's controller:\n\n  ```javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('Hello {{excitedGreeting}}')\n  });\n\n  aController = Ember.Object.create({\n    firstName: 'Barry',\n    excitedGreeting: function() {\n      return this.get(\"content.firstName\") + \"!!!\"\n    }.property()\n  });\n\n  aView = AView.create({\n    controller: aController,\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">Hello Barry!!!</div>\n  ```\n\n  A context can also be explicitly supplied through the view's `context`\n  property. If the view has neither `context` nor `controller` properties, the\n  `parentView`'s context will be used.\n\n  ## Layouts\n\n  Views can have a secondary template that wraps their main template. Like\n  primary templates, layouts can be any function that  accepts an optional\n  context parameter and returns a string of HTML that will be inserted inside\n  view's tag. Views whose HTML element is self closing (e.g. `<input />`)\n  cannot have a layout and this property will be ignored.\n\n  Most typically in Ember a layout will be a compiled `Ember.Handlebars`\n  template.\n\n  A view's layout can be set directly with the `layout` property or reference\n  an existing Handlebars template by name with the `layoutName` property.\n\n  A template used as a layout must contain a single use of the Handlebars\n  `{{yield}}` helper. The HTML contents of a view's rendered `template` will be\n  inserted at this location:\n\n  ```javascript\n  AViewWithLayout = Ember.View.extend({\n    layout: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"<div class='my-decorative-class'>{{yield}}</div>\")\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"I got wrapped\"),\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in view instances with an HTML representation of:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\">\n    <div class=\"my-decorative-class\">\n      I got wrapped\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  See [Ember.Handlebars.helpers.yield](/api/classes/Ember.Handlebars.helpers.html#method_yield)\n  for more information.\n\n  ## Responding to Browser Events\n\n  Views can respond to user-initiated events in one of three ways: method\n  implementation, through an event manager, and through `{{action}}` helper use\n  in their template or layout.\n\n  ### Method Implementation\n\n  Views can respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method that\n  matches the event name. A `jQuery.Event` object will be passed as the\n  argument to this method.\n\n  ```javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    click: function(event) {\n      // will be called when when an instance's\n      // rendered element is clicked\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ### Event Managers\n\n  Views can define an object as their `eventManager` property. This object can\n  then implement methods that match the desired event names. Matching events\n  that occur on the view's rendered HTML or the rendered HTML of any of its DOM\n  descendants will trigger this method. A `jQuery.Event` object will be passed\n  as the first argument to the method and an  `Ember.View` object as the\n  second. The `Ember.View` will be the view whose rendered HTML was interacted\n  with. This may be the view with the `eventManager` property or one of its\n  descendent views.\n\n  ```javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    eventManager: Ember.Object.create({\n      doubleClick: function(event, view) {\n        // will be called when when an instance's\n        // rendered element or any rendering\n        // of this views's descendent\n        // elements is clicked\n      }\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  An event defined for an event manager takes precedence over events of the\n  same name handled through methods on the view.\n\n  ```javascript\n  AView = Ember.View.extend({\n    mouseEnter: function(event) {\n      // will never trigger.\n    },\n    eventManager: Ember.Object.create({\n      mouseEnter: function(event, view) {\n        // takes precedence over AView#mouseEnter\n      }\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Similarly a view's event manager will take precedence for events of any views\n  rendered as a descendent. A method name that matches an event name will not\n  be called if the view instance was rendered inside the HTML representation of\n  a view that has an `eventManager` property defined that handles events of the\n  name. Events not handled by the event manager will still trigger method calls\n  on the descendent.\n\n  ```javascript\n  OuterView = Ember.View.extend({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"outer {{#view InnerView}}inner{{/view}} outer\"),\n    eventManager: Ember.Object.create({\n      mouseEnter: function(event, view) {\n        // view might be instance of either\n        // OuterView or InnerView depending on\n        // where on the page the user interaction occured\n      }\n    })\n  });\n\n  InnerView = Ember.View.extend({\n    click: function(event) {\n      // will be called if rendered inside\n      // an OuterView because OuterView's\n      // eventManager doesn't handle click events\n    },\n    mouseEnter: function(event) {\n      // will never be called if rendered inside\n      // an OuterView.\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ### Handlebars `{{action}}` Helper\n\n  See [Handlebars.helpers.action](/api/classes/Ember.Handlebars.helpers.html#method_action).\n\n  ### Event Names\n\n  All of the event handling approaches described above respond to the same set\n  of events. The names of the built-in events are listed below. (The hash of\n  built-in events exists in `Ember.EventDispatcher`.) Additional, custom events\n  can be registered by using `Ember.Application.customEvents`.\n\n  Touch events:\n\n  * `touchStart`\n  * `touchMove`\n  * `touchEnd`\n  * `touchCancel`\n\n  Keyboard events\n\n  * `keyDown`\n  * `keyUp`\n  * `keyPress`\n\n  Mouse events\n\n  * `mouseDown`\n  * `mouseUp`\n  * `contextMenu`\n  * `click`\n  * `doubleClick`\n  * `mouseMove`\n  * `focusIn`\n  * `focusOut`\n  * `mouseEnter`\n  * `mouseLeave`\n\n  Form events:\n\n  * `submit`\n  * `change`\n  * `focusIn`\n  * `focusOut`\n  * `input`\n\n  HTML5 drag and drop events:\n\n  * `dragStart`\n  * `drag`\n  * `dragEnter`\n  * `dragLeave`\n  * `drop`\n  * `dragEnd`\n\n  ## Handlebars `{{view}}` Helper\n\n  Other `Ember.View` instances can be included as part of a view's template by\n  using the `{{view}}` Handlebars helper. See [Ember.Handlebars.helpers.view](/api/classes/Ember.Handlebars.helpers.html#method_view)\n  for additional information.\n\n  @class View\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.CoreView\n*/\nEmber.View = Ember.CoreView.extend({\n\n  concatenatedProperties: ['classNames', 'classNameBindings', 'attributeBindings'],\n\n  /**\n    @property isView\n    @type Boolean\n    @default true\n    @static\n  */\n  isView: true,\n\n  // ..........................................................\n  // TEMPLATE SUPPORT\n  //\n\n  /**\n    The name of the template to lookup if no template is provided.\n\n    By default `Ember.View` will lookup a template with this name in\n    `Ember.TEMPLATES` (a shared global object).\n\n    @property templateName\n    @type String\n    @default null\n  */\n  templateName: null,\n\n  /**\n    The name of the layout to lookup if no layout is provided.\n\n    By default `Ember.View` will lookup a template with this name in\n    `Ember.TEMPLATES` (a shared global object).\n\n    @property layoutName\n    @type String\n    @default null\n  */\n  layoutName: null,\n\n  /**\n    The template used to render the view.

You can\n  provide a `childViews` property at creation time that contains instance of\n  `Ember.View`:\n\n  ```javascript\n  aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n    childViews: [Ember.View.create(), Ember.View.create()]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  You can also provide a list of property names whose values are instances of\n  `Ember.View`:\n\n  ```javascript\n  aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n    childViews: ['aView', 'bView', 'cView'],\n    aView: Ember.View.create(),\n    bView: Ember.View.create(),\n    cView: Ember.View.create()\n  });\n  ```\n\n  The two strategies can be combined:\n\n  ```javascript\n  aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n    childViews: ['aView', Ember.View.create()],\n    aView: Ember.View.create()\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Each child view's rendering will be inserted into the container's rendered\n  HTML in the same order as its position in the `childViews` property.\n\n  ## Adding and Removing Child Views\n\n  The container view implements `Ember.MutableArray` allowing programmatic management of its child views.\n\n  To remove a view, pass that view into a `removeObject` call on the container view.\n\n  Given an empty `<body>` the following code\n\n  ```javascript\n  aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n    classNames: ['the-container'],\n    childViews: ['aView', 'bView'],\n    aView: Ember.View.create({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"A\")\n    }),\n    bView: Ember.View.create({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"B\")\n    })\n  });\n\n  aContainer.appendTo('body');\n  ```\n\n  Results in the HTML\n\n  ```html\n  <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">A</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">B</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  Removing a view\n\n  ```javascript\n  aContainer.toArray();  // [aContainer.aView, aContainer.bView]\n  aContainer.removeObject(aContainer.get('bView'));\n  aContainer.toArray();  // [aContainer.aView]\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the following HTML\n\n  ```html\n  <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">A</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  Similarly, adding a child view is accomplished by adding `Ember.View` instances to the\n  container view.\n\n  Given an empty `<body>` the following code\n\n  ```javascript\n  aContainer = Ember.ContainerView.create({\n    classNames: ['the-container'],\n    childViews: ['aView', 'bView'],\n    aView: Ember.View.create({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"A\")\n    }),\n    bView: Ember.View.create({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"B\")\n    })\n  });\n\n  aContainer.appendTo('body');\n  ```\n\n  Results in the HTML\n\n  ```html\n  <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">A</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">B</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  Adding a view\n\n  ```javascript\n  AnotherViewClass = Ember.View.extend({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"Another view\")\n  });\n\n  aContainer.toArray();  // [aContainer.aView, aContainer.bView]\n  aContainer.pushObject(AnotherViewClass.create());\n  aContainer.toArray(); // [aContainer.aView, aContainer.bView, <AnotherViewClass instance>]\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the following HTML\n\n  ```html\n  <div class=\"ember-view the-container\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">A</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">B</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Another view</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  ## Templates and Layout\n\n  A `template`, `templateName`, `defaultTemplate`, `layout`, `layoutName` or\n  `defaultLayout` property on a container view will not result in the template\n  or layout being rendered.

You can supply a different class by setting the\n  `CollectionView`'s `itemViewClass` property.\n\n  Given an empty `<body>` and the following code:\n\n  ```javascript\n  someItemsView = Ember.CollectionView.create({\n    classNames: ['a-collection'],\n    content: ['A','B','C'],\n    itemViewClass: Ember.View.extend({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"the letter: {{view.content}}\")\n    })\n  });\n\n  someItemsView.appendTo('body');\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the following HTML structure\n\n  ```html\n  <div class=\"ember-view a-collection\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">the letter: A</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">the letter: B</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">the letter: C</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  ## Automatic matching of parent/child tagNames\n\n  Setting the `tagName` property of a `CollectionView` to any of\n  \"ul\", \"ol\", \"table\", \"thead\", \"tbody\", \"tfoot\", \"tr\", or \"select\" will result\n  in the item views receiving an appropriately matched `tagName` property.\n\n  Given an empty `<body>` and the following code:\n\n  ```javascript\n  anUnorderedListView = Ember.CollectionView.create({\n    tagName: 'ul',\n    content: ['A','B','C'],\n    itemViewClass: Ember.View.extend({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"the letter: {{view.content}}\")\n    })\n  });\n\n  anUnorderedListView.appendTo('body');\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the following HTML structure\n\n  ```html\n  <ul class=\"ember-view a-collection\">\n    <li class=\"ember-view\">the letter: A</li>\n    <li class=\"ember-view\">the letter: B</li>\n    <li class=\"ember-view\">the letter: C</li>\n  </ul>\n  ```\n\n  Additional `tagName` pairs can be provided by adding to\n  `Ember.CollectionView.CONTAINER_MAP `\n\n  ```javascript\n  Ember.CollectionView.CONTAINER_MAP['article'] = 'section'\n  ```\n\n  ## Programmatic creation of child views\n\n  For cases where additional customization beyond the use of a single\n  `itemViewClass` or `tagName` matching is required CollectionView's\n  `createChildView` method can be overidden:\n\n  ```javascript\n  CustomCollectionView = Ember.CollectionView.extend({\n    createChildView: function(viewClass, attrs) {\n      if (attrs.content.kind == 'album') {\n        viewClass = App.AlbumView;\n      } else {\n        viewClass = App.SongView;\n      }\n      return this._super(viewClass, attrs);\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ## Empty View\n\n  You can provide an `Ember.View` subclass to the `Ember.CollectionView`\n  instance as its `emptyView` property. If the `content` property of a\n  `CollectionView` is set to `null` or an empty array, an instance of this view\n  will be the `CollectionView`s only child.\n\n  ```javascript\n  aListWithNothing = Ember.CollectionView.create({\n    classNames: ['nothing']\n    content: null,\n    emptyView: Ember.View.extend({\n      template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"The collection is empty\")\n    })\n  });\n\n  aListWithNothing.appendTo('body');\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the following HTML structure\n\n  ```html\n  <div class=\"ember-view nothing\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">\n      The collection is empty\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  ## Adding and Removing items\n\n  The `childViews` property of a `CollectionView` should not be directly\n  manipulated.

Property access in its templates go\n  to the view object and actions are targeted at\n  the view object. There is no access to the\n  surrounding context or outer controller; all\n  contextual information must be passed in.\n\n  The easiest way to create an `Ember.Component` is via\n  a template. If you name a template\n  `components/my-foo`, you will be able to use\n  `{{my-foo}}` in other templates, which will make\n  an instance of the isolated component.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{app-profile person=currentUser}}\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <!-- app-profile template -->\n  <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n  <img {{bind-attr src=person.avatar}}>\n  <p class='signature'>{{person.signature}}</p>\n  ```\n\n  You can use `yield` inside a template to\n  include the **contents** of any block attached to\n  the component. The block will be executed in the\n  context of the surrounding context or outer controller:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{#app-profile person=currentUser}}\n    <p>Admin mode</p>\n    {{! Executed in the controller's context. }}\n  {{/app-profile}}\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <!-- app-profile template -->\n  <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n  {{! Executed in the components context. }}\n  {{yield}} {{! block contents }}\n  ```\n\n  If you want to customize the component, in order to\n  handle events or actions, you implement a subclass\n  of `Ember.Component` named after the name of the\n  component. Note that `Component` needs to be appended to the name of\n  your subclass like `AppProfileComponent`.\n\n  For example, you could implement the action\n  `hello` for the `app-profile` component:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.AppProfileComponent = Ember.Component.extend({\n    actions: {\n      hello: function(name) {\n        console.log(\"Hello\", name);\n      }\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  And then use it in the component's template:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <!-- app-profile template -->\n\n  <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>\n  {{yield}} <!-- block contents -->\n\n  <button {{action 'hello' person.name}}>\n    Say Hello to {{person.name}}\n  </button>\n  ```\n\n  Components must have a `-` in their name to avoid\n  conflicts with built-in controls that wrap HTML\n  elements. This is consistent with the same\n  requirement in web components.\n\n  @class Component\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.View\n*/\nEmber.Component = Ember.View.extend(Ember.TargetActionSupport, Ember.ComponentTemplateDeprecation, {\n  init: function() {\n    this._super();\n    set(this, 'context', this);\n    set(this, 'controller', this);\n  },\n\n  defaultLayout: function(context, options){\n    Ember.Handlebars.helpers['yield'].call(context, options);\n  },\n\n  /**\n  A components template property is set by passing a block\n  during its invocation.

Example:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{repeat text countBinding=\"numRepeats\"}}\n  ```\n\n  In this example, count will be bound to the value of\n  the `numRepeats` property on the context. If that property\n  changes, the helper will be re-rendered.\n\n  ## Example with extra dependencies\n\n  The `Ember.Handlebars.registerBoundHelper` method takes a variable length\n  third parameter which indicates extra dependencies on the passed in value.\n  This allows the handlebars helper to update when these dependencies change.\n\n  ```javascript\n  Ember.Handlebars.registerBoundHelper('capitalizeName', function(value) {\n    return value.get('name').toUpperCase();\n  }, 'name');\n  ```\n\n  ## Example with multiple bound properties\n\n  `Ember.Handlebars.registerBoundHelper` supports binding to\n  multiple properties, e.g.:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Ember.Handlebars.registerBoundHelper('concatenate', function() {\n    var values = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0, -1);\n    return values.join('||');\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Which allows for template syntax such as `{{concatenate prop1 prop2}}` or\n  `{{concatenate prop1 prop2 prop3}}`. If any of the properties change,\n  the helpr will re-render.  Note that dependency keys cannot be\n  using in conjunction with multi-property helpers, since it is ambiguous\n  which property the dependent keys would belong to.\n\n  ## Use with unbound helper\n\n  The `{{unbound}}` helper can be used with bound helper invocations\n  to render them in their unbound form, e.g.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{unbound capitalize name}}\n  ```\n\n  In this example, if the name property changes, the helper\n  will not re-render.\n\n  ## Use with blocks not supported\n\n  Bound helpers do not support use with Handlebars blocks or\n  the addition of child views of any kind.\n\n  @method registerBoundHelper\n  @for Ember.Handlebars\n  @param {String} name\n  @param {Function} function\n  @param {String} dependentKeys*\n*/\nEmber.Handlebars.registerBoundHelper = function(name, fn) {\n  var boundHelperArgs = slice.call(arguments, 1),\n      boundFn = Ember.Handlebars.makeBoundHelper.apply(this, boundHelperArgs);\n  Ember.Handlebars.registerHelper(name, boundFn);\n};\n\n/**\n  A (mostly) private helper function to `registerBoundHelper`. Takes the\n  provided Handlebars helper function fn and returns it in wrapped\n  bound helper form.\n\n  The main use case for using this outside of `registerBoundHelper`\n  is for registering helpers on the container:\n\n  ```js\n  var boundHelperFn = Ember.Handlebars.makeBoundHelper(function(word) {\n    return word.toUpperCase();\n  });\n\n  container.register('helper:my-bound-helper', boundHelperFn);\n  ```\n\n  In the above example, if the helper function hadn't been wrapped in\n  `makeBoundHelper`, the registered helper would be unbound.\n\n  @private\n  @method makeBoundHelper\n  @for Ember.Handlebars\n  @param {Function} function\n  @param {String} dependentKeys*\n*/\nEmber.Handlebars.makeBoundHelper = function(fn) {\n  var dependentKeys = slice.call(arguments, 1);\n\n  function helper() {\n    var properties = slice.call(arguments, 0, -1),\n      numProperties = properties.length,\n      options = arguments[arguments.length - 1],\n      normalizedProperties = [],\n      data = options.data,\n      types = data.isUnbound ? slice.call(options.types, 1) : options.types,\n      hash = options.hash,\n      view = data.view,\n      contexts = options.contexts,\n      currentContext = (contexts && contexts.length) ? contexts[0] : this,\n      prefixPathForDependentKeys = '',\n      loc, len, hashOption,\n      boundOption, property,\n      normalizedValue = Ember._SimpleHandlebarsView.prototype.normalizedValue;\n\n    Ember.assert(\"registerBoundHelper-generated helpers do not support use with Handlebars blocks.\", !options.fn);\n\n    // Detect bound options (e.g. countBinding=\"otherCount\")\n    var boundOptions = hash.boundOptions = {};\n    for (hashOption in hash) {\n      if (Ember.IS_BINDING.test(hashOption)) {\n        // Lop off 'Binding' suffix.\n        boundOptions[hashOption.slice(0, -7)] = hash[hashOption];\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Expose property names on data.properties object.\n    var watchedProperties = [];\n    data.properties = [];\n    for (loc = 0;

It's helpful for semantic clarity and to retain \n  default scope or to reference from another `{{with}}` block.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  // posts might not be\n  {{#with user.posts as blogPosts}}\n    <div class=\"notice\">\n      There are {{blogPosts.length}} blog posts written by {{user.name}}.\n    </div>\n\n    {{#each post in blogPosts}}\n      <li>{{post.title}}</li>\n    {{/each}}\n  {{/with}}\n  ```\n\n  Without the `as` operator, it would be impossible to reference `user.name` in the example above.\n\n  ### `controller` option\n\n  Adding `controller='something'` instructs the `{{with}}` helper to create and use an instance of\n  the specified controller with the new context as its content.\n\n  This is very similar to using an `itemController` option with the `{{each}}` helper.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{#with users.posts controller='userBlogPosts'}}\n    {{!- The current context is wrapped in our controller instance }}\n  {{/with}}\n  ```\n\n  In the above example, the template provided to the `{{with}}` block is now wrapped in the\n  `userBlogPost` controller, which provides a very elegant way to decorate the context with custom\n  functions/properties.\n\n  @method with\n  @for Ember.Handlebars.helpers\n  @param {Function} context\n  @param {Hash} options\n  @return {String} HTML string\n*/\nEmberHandlebars.registerHelper('with', function withHelper(context, options) {\n  if (arguments.length === 4) {\n    var keywordName, path, rootPath, normalized, contextPath;\n\n    Ember.assert(\"If you pass more than one argument to the with helper, it must be in the form #with foo as bar\", arguments[1] === \"as\");\n    options = arguments[3];\n    keywordName = arguments[2];\n    path = arguments[0];\n\n    Ember.assert(\"You must pass a block to the with helper\", options.fn && options.fn !== Handlebars.VM.noop);\n\n    var localizedOptions = o_create(options);\n    localizedOptions.data = o_create(options.data);\n    localizedOptions.data.keywords = o_create(options.data.keywords || {});\n\n    if (Ember.isGlobalPath(path)) {\n      contextPath = path;\n    } else {\n      normalized = normalizePath(this, path, options.data);\n      path = normalized.path;\n      rootPath = normalized.root;\n\n      // This is a workaround for the fact that you cannot bind separate objects\n      // together.

For example:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <img {{bind-attr src=\"imageUrl\" alt=\"imageTitle\"}}>\n  ```\n\n  The above handlebars template will fill the `<img>`'s `src` attribute will\n  the value of the property referenced with `\"imageUrl\"` and its `alt`\n  attribute with the value of the property referenced with `\"imageTitle\"`.\n\n  If the rendering context of this template is the following object:\n\n  ```javascript\n  {\n    imageUrl: 'http://lolcats.info/haz-a-funny',\n    imageTitle: 'A humorous image of a cat'\n  }\n  ```\n\n  The resulting HTML output will be:\n\n  ```html\n  <img src=\"http://lolcats.info/haz-a-funny\" alt=\"A humorous image of a cat\">\n  ```\n\n  `bind-attr` cannot redeclare existing DOM element attributes. The use of `src`\n  in the following `bind-attr` example will be ignored and the hard coded value\n  of `src=\"/failwhale.gif\"` will take precedence:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <img src=\"/failwhale.gif\" {{bind-attr src=\"imageUrl\" alt=\"imageTitle\"}}>\n  ```\n\n  ### `bind-attr` and the `class` attribute\n\n  `bind-attr` supports a special syntax for handling a number of cases unique\n  to the `class` DOM element attribute. The `class` attribute combines\n  multiple discrete values into a single attribute as a space-delimited\n  list of strings. Each string can be:\n\n  * a string return value of an object's property.\n  * a boolean return value of an object's property\n  * a hard-coded value\n\n  A string return value works identically to other uses of `bind-attr`. The\n  return value of the property will become the value of the attribute.

Attempts to use both a `templateName` option and supply a\n  block will throw an error.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{view \"MyApp.ViewWithATemplateDefined\"}}\n  ```\n\n  ### `viewName` property\n\n  You can supply a `viewName` option to `{{view}}`. The `Ember.View` instance\n  will be referenced as a property of its parent view by this name.\n\n  ```javascript\n  aView = Ember.View.create({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile('{{#view viewName=\"aChildByName\"}} hi {{/view}}')\n  });\n\n  aView.appendTo('body');\n  aView.get('aChildByName') // the instance of Ember.View created by {{view}} helper\n  ```\n\n  @method view\n  @for Ember.Handlebars.helpers\n  @param {String} path\n  @param {Hash} options\n  @return {String} HTML string\n*/\nEmberHandlebars.registerHelper('view', function viewHelper(path, options) {\n  Ember.assert(\"The view helper only takes a single argument\", arguments.length <= 2);\n\n  // If no path is provided, treat path param as options.\n  if (path && path.data && path.data.isRenderData) {\n    options = path;\n    path = \"Ember.View\";\n  }\n\n  return EmberHandlebars.ViewHelper.helper(this, path, options);\n});\n\n\n})();\n\n\n\n(function() {\n// TODO: Don't require all of this module\n/**\n@module ember\n@submodule ember-handlebars\n*/\n\nvar get = Ember.get, handlebarsGet = Ember.Handlebars.get, fmt = Ember.String.fmt;\n\n/**\n  `{{collection}}` is a `Ember.Handlebars` helper for adding instances of\n  `Ember.CollectionView` to a template.

Each view\n  will have its own `content` property set to the appropriate item in the\n  collection.\n\n  The provided block will be applied as the template for each item's view.\n\n  Given an empty `<body>` the following template:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{#collection contentBinding=\"App.items\"}}\n    Hi {{view.content.name}}\n  {{/collection}}\n  ```\n\n  And the following application code\n\n  ```javascript\n  App = Ember.Application.create()\n  App.items = [\n    Ember.Object.create({name: 'Dave'}),\n    Ember.Object.create({name: 'Mary'}),\n    Ember.Object.create({name: 'Sara'})\n  ]\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the HTML structure below\n\n  ```html\n  <div class=\"ember-view\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Hi Dave</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Hi Mary</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Hi Sara</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  ### Blockless use in a collection\n\n  If you provide an `itemViewClass` option that has its own `template` you can\n  omit the block.\n\n  The following template:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{collection contentBinding=\"App.items\" itemViewClass=\"App.AnItemView\"}}\n  ```\n\n  And application code\n\n  ```javascript\n  App = Ember.Application.create();\n  App.items = [\n    Ember.Object.create({name: 'Dave'}),\n    Ember.Object.create({name: 'Mary'}),\n    Ember.Object.create({name: 'Sara'})\n  ];\n\n  App.AnItemView = Ember.View.extend({\n    template: Ember.Handlebars.compile(\"Greetings {{view.content.name}}\")\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the HTML structure below\n\n  ```html\n  <div class=\"ember-view\">\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Greetings Dave</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Greetings Mary</div>\n    <div class=\"ember-view\">Greetings Sara</div>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  ### Specifying a CollectionView subclass\n\n  By default the `{{collection}}` helper will create an instance of\n  `Ember.CollectionView`. You can supply a `Ember.CollectionView` subclass to\n  the helper by passing it as the first argument:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{#collection App.MyCustomCollectionClass contentBinding=\"App.items\"}}\n    Hi {{view.content.name}}\n  {{/collection}}\n  ```\n\n  ### Forwarded `item.*`-named Options\n\n  As with the `{{view}}`, helper options passed to the `{{collection}}` will be\n  set on the resulting `Ember.CollectionView` as properties. Additionally,\n  options prefixed with `item` will be applied to the views rendered for each\n  item (note the camelcasing):\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{#collection contentBinding=\"App.items\"\n                itemTagName=\"p\"\n                itemClassNames=\"greeting\"}}\n    Howdy {{view.content.name}}\n  {{/collection}}\n  ```\n\n  Will result in the following HTML structure:\n\n  ```html\n  <div class=\"ember-view\">\n    <p class=\"ember-view greeting\">Howdy Dave</p>\n    <p class=\"ember-view greeting\">Howdy Mary</p>\n    <p class=\"ember-view greeting\">Howdy Sara</p>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  @method collection\n  @for Ember.Handlebars.helpers\n  @param {String} path\n  @param {Hash} options\n  @return {String} HTML string\n  @deprecated Use `{{each}}` helper instead.\n*/\nEmber.Handlebars.registerHelper('collection', function collectionHelper(path, options) {\n  Ember.deprecate(\"Using the {{collection}} helper without specifying a class has been deprecated as the {{each}} helper now supports the same functionality.\", path !== 'collection');\n\n  // If no path is provided, treat path param as options.\n  if (path && path.data && path.data.isRenderData) {\n    options = path;\n    path = undefined;\n    Ember.assert(\"You cannot pass more than one argument to the collection helper\", arguments.length === 1);\n  } else {\n    Ember.assert(\"You cannot pass more than one argument to the collection helper\", arguments.length === 2);\n  }\n\n  var fn = options.fn;\n  var data = options.data;\n  var inverse = options.inverse;\n  var view = options.data.view;\n\n\n  var controller, container;\n  // If passed a path string, convert that into an object.\n  // Otherwise, just default to the standard class.\n  var collectionClass;\n  if (path) {\n    controller = data.keywords.controller;\n    container = controller && controller.container;\n    collectionClass = handlebarsGet(this, path, options) || container.lookupFactory('view:' + path); \n    Ember.assert(fmt(\"%@ #collection: Could not find collection class %@\", [data.view, path]), !!collectionClass);\n  }\n  else {\n    collectionClass = Ember.CollectionView;\n  }\n\n  var hash = options.hash, itemHash = {}, match;\n\n  // Extract item view class if provided else default to the standard class\n  var collectionPrototype = collectionClass.proto(),\n      itemViewClass;\n\n  if (hash.itemView) {\n    controller = data.keywords.controller;\n    Ember.assert('You specified an itemView, but the current context has no ' +\n                 'container to look the itemView up in.

That is, the `emptyViewClass` will render if the collection\n  is empty.\n\n  ### Representing each item with a Controller.\n  By default the controller lookup within an `{{#each}}` block will be\n  the controller of the template where the `{{#each}}` was used. If each\n  item needs to be presented by a custom controller you can provide a\n  `itemController` option which references a controller by lookup name.\n  Each item in the loop will be wrapped in an instance of this controller\n  and the item itself will be set to the `content` property of that controller.\n\n  This is useful in cases where properties of model objects need transformation\n  or synthesis for display:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.DeveloperController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({\n    isAvailableForHire: function() {\n      return !this.get('content.isEmployed') && this.get('content.isSeekingWork');\n    }.property('isEmployed', 'isSeekingWork')\n  })\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{#each person in developers itemController=\"developer\"}}\n    {{person.name}} {{#if person.isAvailableForHire}}Hire me!{{/if}}\n  {{/each}}\n  ```\n\n  Each itemController will receive a reference to the current controller as\n  a `parentController` property.\n\n  ### (Experimental) Grouped Each\n\n  When used in conjunction with the experimental [group helper](https://github.com/emberjs/group-helper),\n  you can inform Handlebars to re-render an entire group of items instead of\n  re-rendering them one at a time (in the event that they are changed en masse\n  or an item is added/removed).\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{#group}}\n    {{#each people}}\n      {{firstName}} {{lastName}}\n    {{/each}}\n  {{/group}}\n  ```\n\n  This can be faster than the normal way that Handlebars re-renders items\n  in some cases.\n\n  If for some reason you have a group with more than one `#each`, you can make\n  one of the collections be updated in normal (non-grouped) fashion by setting\n  the option `groupedRows=true` (counter-intuitive, I know).\n\n  For example,\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{dealershipName}}\n\n  {{#group}}\n    {{#each dealers}}\n      {{firstName}} {{lastName}}\n    {{/each}}\n\n    {{#each car in cars groupedRows=true}}\n      {{car.make}} {{car.model}} {{car.color}}\n    {{/each}}\n  {{/group}}\n  ```\n  Any change to `dealershipName` or the `dealers` collection will cause the\n  entire group to be re-rendered.

The underlying data object of the selected `<option>` is\n  stored in the `Element.Select`'s `value` property.\n\n  ## The Content Property (array of strings)\n\n  The simplest version of an `Ember.Select` takes an array of strings as its\n  `content` property. The string will be used as both the `value` property and\n  the inner text of each `<option>` element inside the rendered `<select>`.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n    names: [\"Yehuda\", \"Tom\"]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select content=names}}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML:\n\n  ```html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option value=\"Yehuda\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"Tom\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n  You can control which `<option>` is selected through the `Ember.Select`'s\n  `value` property:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n    selectedName: 'Tom',\n    names: [\"Yehuda\", \"Tom\"]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select\n         content=names\n         value=selectedName\n  }}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML with the `<option>` for 'Tom' selected:\n\n  ```html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option value=\"Yehuda\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"Tom\" selected=\"selected\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n  A user interacting with the rendered `<select>` to choose \"Yehuda\" would\n  update the value of `selectedName` to \"Yehuda\".\n\n  ## The Content Property (array of Objects)\n\n  An `Ember.Select` can also take an array of JavaScript or Ember objects as\n  its `content` property.\n\n  When using objects you need to tell the `Ember.Select` which property should\n  be accessed on each object to supply the `value` attribute of the `<option>`\n  and which property should be used to supply the element text.\n\n  The `optionValuePath` option is used to specify the path on each object to\n  the desired property for the `value` attribute. The `optionLabelPath`\n  specifies the path on each object to the desired property for the\n  element's text. Both paths must reference each object itself as `content`:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n    programmers: [\n      {firstName: \"Yehuda\", id: 1},\n      {firstName: \"Tom\",    id: 2}\n    ]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select\n         content=programmers\n         optionValuePath=\"content.id\"\n         optionLabelPath=\"content.firstName\"}}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML:\n\n  ```html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option value=\"1\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"2\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n  The `value` attribute of the selected `<option>` within an `Ember.Select`\n  can be bound to a property on another object:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n    programmers: [\n      {firstName: \"Yehuda\", id: 1},\n      {firstName: \"Tom\",    id: 2}\n    ],\n    currentProgrammer: {\n      id: 2\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select\n         content=programmers\n         optionValuePath=\"content.id\"\n         optionLabelPath=\"content.firstName\"\n         value=currentProgrammer.id}}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML with a selected option:\n\n  ```html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option value=\"1\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"2\" selected=\"selected\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n  Interacting with the rendered element by selecting the first option\n  ('Yehuda') will update the `id` of `currentProgrammer`\n  to match the `value` property of the newly selected `<option>`.\n\n  Alternatively, you can control selection through the underlying objects\n  used to render each object by binding the `selection` option. When the selected\n  `<option>` is changed, the property path provided to `selection`\n  will be updated to match the content object of the rendered `<option>`\n  element:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n    selectedPerson: null,\n    programmers: [\n      {firstName: \"Yehuda\", id: 1},\n      {firstName: \"Tom\",    id: 2}\n    ]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select\n         content=programmers\n         optionValuePath=\"content.id\"\n         optionLabelPath=\"content.firstName\"\n         selection=selectedPerson}}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML with a selected option:\n\n  ```html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option value=\"1\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"2\" selected=\"selected\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n  Interacting with the rendered element by selecting the first option\n  ('Yehuda') will update the `selectedPerson` to match the object of\n  the newly selected `<option>`. In this case it is the first object\n  in the `programmers`\n\n  ## Supplying a Prompt\n\n  A `null` value for the `Ember.Select`'s `value` or `selection` property\n  results in there being no `<option>` with a `selected` attribute:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n    selectedProgrammer: null,\n    programmers: [\n      \"Yehuda\",\n      \"Tom\"\n    ]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ``` handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select\n         content=programmers\n         value=selectedProgrammer\n  }}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML:\n\n  ```html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option value=\"Yehuda\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"Tom\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n  Although `selectedProgrammer` is `null` and no `<option>`\n  has a `selected` attribute the rendered HTML will display the\n  first item as though it were selected. You can supply a string\n  value for the `Ember.Select` to display when there is no selection\n  with the `prompt` option:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n    selectedProgrammer: null,\n    programmers: [\n      \"Yehuda\",\n      \"Tom\"\n    ]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{view Ember.Select\n         content=programmers\n         value=selectedProgrammer\n         prompt=\"Please select a name\"\n  }}\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML:\n\n  ```html\n  <select class=\"ember-select\">\n    <option>Please select a name</option>\n    <option value=\"Yehuda\">Yehuda</option>\n    <option value=\"Tom\">Tom</option>\n  </select>\n  ```\n\n  @class Select\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.View\n*/\nEmber.Select = Ember.View.extend({\n  tagName: 'select',\n  classNames: ['ember-select'],\n  defaultTemplate: Ember.Handlebars.template(function anonymous(Handlebars,depth0,helpers,partials,data) {\nthis.compilerInfo = [4,'>= 1.0.0'];\nhelpers = this.merge(helpers, Ember.Handlebars.helpers); data = data || {};\n  var buffer = '', stack1, escapeExpression=this.escapeExpression, self=this;\n\nfunction program1(depth0,data) {\n  \n  var buffer = '', stack1;\n  data.buffer.push(\"<option value=\\\"\\\">\");\n  stack1 = helpers._triageMustache.call(depth0, \"view.prompt\", {hash:{},hashTypes:{},hashContexts:{},contexts:[depth0],types:[\"ID\"],data:data});\n  if(stack1 || stack1 === 0) { data.buffer.push(stack1); }\n  data.buffer.push(\"</option>\");\n  return buffer;\n  }\n\nfunction program3(depth0,data) {\n  \n  var stack1;\n  stack1 = helpers.each.call(depth0, \"view.groupedContent\", {hash:{},hashTypes:{},hashContexts:{},inverse:self.noop,fn:self.program(4, program4, data),contexts:[depth0],types:[\"ID\"],data:data});\n  if(stack1 || stack1 === 0) { data.buffer.push(stack1); }\n  else { data.buffer.push(''); }\n  }\nfunction program4(depth0,data) {\n  \n  \n  data.buffer.push(escapeExpression(helpers.view.call(depth0, \"view.groupView\", {hash:{\n    'content': (\"content\"),\n    'label': (\"label\")\n  },hashTypes:{'content': \"ID\",'label': \"ID\"},hashContexts:{'content': depth0,'label': depth0},contexts:[depth0],types:[\"ID\"],data:data})));\n  }\n\nfunction program6(depth0,data) {\n  \n  var stack1;\n  stack1 = helpers.each.call(depth0, \"view.content\", {hash:{},hashTypes:{},hashContexts:{},inverse:self.noop,fn:self.program(7, program7, data),contexts:[depth0],types:[\"ID\"],data:data});\n  if(stack1 || stack1 === 0) { data.buffer.push(stack1); }\n  else { data.buffer.push(''); }\n  }\nfunction program7(depth0,data) {\n  \n  \n  data.buffer.push(escapeExpression(helpers.view.call(depth0, \"view.optionView\", {hash:{\n    'content': (\"\")\n  },hashTypes:{'content': \"ID\"},hashContexts:{'content': depth0},contexts:[depth0],types:[\"ID\"],data:data})));\n  }\n\n  stack1 = helpers['if'].call(depth0, \"view.prompt\", {hash:{},hashTypes:{},hashContexts:{},inverse:self.noop,fn:self.program(1, program1, data),contexts:[depth0],types:[\"ID\"],data:data});\n  if(stack1 || stack1 === 0) { data.buffer.push(stack1); }\n  stack1 = helpers['if'].call(depth0, \"view.optionGroupPath\", {hash:{},hashTypes:{},hashContexts:{},inverse:self.program(6, program6, data),fn:self.program(3, program3, data),contexts:[depth0],types:[\"ID\"],data:data});\n  if(stack1 || stack1 === 0) { data.buffer.push(stack1); }\n  return buffer;\n  \n}),\n  attributeBindings: ['multiple', 'disabled', 'tabindex', 'name'],\n\n  /**\n    The `multiple` attribute of the select element.

If no `type` is provided,\n  `text` will be the default value applied. The attributes of `{{input}}`\n  match those of the native HTML tag as closely as possible for these two types.\n\n  ## Use as text field\n  An `{{input}}` with no `type` or a `type` of `text` will render an HTML text input.\n  The following HTML attributes can be set via the helper:\n\n* `value`\n* `size`\n* `name`\n* `pattern`\n* `placeholder`\n* `disabled`\n* `maxlength`\n* `tabindex`\n\n\n  When set to a quoted string, these values will be directly applied to the HTML\n  element.

You can extend the\n  capablilties of text inputs in your applications by reopening this class. For example,\n  if you are deploying to browsers where the `required` attribute is used, you\n  can add this to the `TextField`'s `attributeBindings` property:\n\n\n  ```javascript\n  Ember.TextField.reopen({\n    attributeBindings: ['required']\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Keep in mind when writing `Ember.TextField` subclasses that `Ember.TextField`\n  itself extends `Ember.Component`, meaning that it does NOT inherit\n  the `controller` of the parent view.\n\n  See more about [Ember components](api/classes/Ember.Component.html)\n\n\n  ## Use as checkbox\n\n  An `{{input}}` with a `type` of `checkbox` will render an HTML checkbox input.\n  The following HTML attributes can be set via the helper:\n\n* `checked`\n* `disabled`\n* `tabindex`\n* `indeterminate`\n* `name`\n\n\n  When set to a quoted string, these values will be directly applied to the HTML\n  element. When left unquoted, these values will be bound to a property on the\n  template's current rendering context (most typically a controller instance).\n\n  ## Unbound:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"isAdmin\"}}\n  ```\n\n  ```html\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"isAdmin\" />\n  ```\n\n  ## Bound:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n    isAdmin: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{input type=\"checkbox\" checked=isAdmin }}\n  ```\n\n\n  ```html\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" checked=\"checked\" />\n  ```\n\n  ## Extension\n\n  Internally, `{{input type=\"checkbox\"}}` creates an instance of `Ember.Checkbox`, passing\n  arguments from the helper to `Ember.Checkbox`'s `create` method.

Type into\n  either text area box and they'll both stay in sync. Note that\n  `Ember.computed.alias` costs more in terms of performance, so only use it when\n  your really binding in both directions:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.ApplicationController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n    writtenWords: \"Lots of text that IS bound\",\n    twoWayWrittenWords: Ember.computed.alias(\"writtenWords\")\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{textarea value=writtenWords}}\n  {{textarea value=twoWayWrittenWords}}\n  ```\n\n  ```html\n  <textarea id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-text-area\">\n    Lots of text that IS bound\n  </textarea>\n\n  <-- both updated in real time -->\n\n  <textarea id=\"ember2\" class=\"ember-text-area\">\n    Lots of text that IS bound\n  </textarea>\n  ```\n\n  ## Extension\n\n  Internally, `{{textarea}}` creates an instance of `Ember.TextArea`, passing\n  arguments from the helper to `Ember.TextArea`'s `create` method. You can\n  extend the capabilities of text areas in your application by reopening this\n  class. For example, if you are deploying to browsers where the `required`\n  attribute is used, you can globally add support for the `required` attribute\n  on all `{{textarea}}`s' in your app by reopening `Ember.TextArea` or\n  `Ember.TextSupport` and adding it to the `attributeBindings` concatenated\n  property:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Ember.TextArea.reopen({\n    attributeBindings: ['required']\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Keep in mind when writing `Ember.TextArea` subclasses that `Ember.TextArea`\n  itself extends `Ember.Component`, meaning that it does NOT inherit\n  the `controller` of the parent view.\n\n  See more about [Ember components](api/classes/Ember.Component.html)\n\n  @method textarea\n  @for Ember.Handlebars.helpers\n  @param {Hash} options\n*/\nEmber.Handlebars.registerHelper('textarea', function(options) {\n  Ember.assert('You can only pass attributes to the `textarea` helper, not arguments', arguments.length < 2);\n\n  var hash = options.hash,\n      types = options.hashTypes;\n\n  return Ember.Handlebars.helpers.view.call(this, Ember.TextArea, options);\n});\n\n})();\n\n\n\n(function() {\nEmber.ComponentLookup = Ember.Object.extend({\n  lookupFactory: function(name, container) {\n\n    container = container || this.container;\n\n    var fullName = 'component:' + name,\n        templateFullName = 'template:components/' + name,\n        templateRegistered = container && container.has(templateFullName);\n\n    if (templateRegistered) {\n      container.injection(fullName, 'layout', templateFullName);\n    }\n\n    var Component = container.lookupFactory(fullName);\n\n    // Only treat as a component if either the component\n    // or a template has been registered.\n    if (templateRegistered || Component) {\n      if (!Component) {\n        container.register(fullName, Ember.Component);\n        Component = container.lookupFactory(fullName);\n      }\n      return Component;\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n})();\n\n\n\n(function() {\n/*globals Handlebars */\n/**\n@module ember\n@submodule ember-handlebars\n*/\n\n/**\n  Find templates stored in the head tag as script tags and make them available\n  to `Ember.CoreView` in the global `Ember.TEMPLATES` object.

If you need to\n    define a specific view, set this property.\n\n    This is useful when multiple routes would benefit from using the same view\n    because it doesn't require a custom `renderTemplate` method. For example,\n    the following routes will all render using the `App.PostsListView` view:\n\n    ```js\n    var PostsList = Ember.Route.extend({\n      viewName: 'postsList',\n    });\n\n    App.PostsIndexRoute = PostsList.extend();\n    App.PostsArchivedRoute = PostsList.extend();\n    ```\n\n    @property viewName\n    @type String\n    @default null\n  */\n  viewName: null,\n\n  /**\n    The name of the template to use by default when rendering this routes\n    template.\n\n    This is similar with `viewName`, but is useful when you just want a custom\n    template without a view.\n\n    ```js\n    var PostsList = Ember.Route.extend({\n      templateName: 'posts/list'\n    });\n\n    App.PostsIndexRoute = PostsList.extend();\n    App.PostsArchivedRoute = PostsList.extend();\n    ```\n\n    @property templateName\n    @type String\n    @default null\n  */\n  templateName: null,\n\n  /**\n    The name of the controller to associate with this route.\n\n    By default, Ember will lookup a route's controller that matches the name\n    of the route (i.e. `App.PostController` for `App.PostRoute`).

To continue bubbling the action,\n    you must return `true` from the handler:\n\n    ```js\n    App.Router.map(function() {\n      this.resource(\"album\", function() {\n        this.route(\"song\");\n      });\n    });\n\n    App.AlbumRoute = Ember.Route.extend({\n      actions: {\n        startPlaying: function() {\n        }\n      }\n    });\n\n    App.AlbumSongRoute = Ember.Route.extend({\n      actions: {\n        startPlaying: function() {\n          // ...\n\n          if (actionShouldAlsoBeTriggeredOnParentRoute) {\n            return true;\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ## Built-in actions\n\n    There are a few built-in actions pertaining to transitions that you\n    can use to customize transition behavior: `willTransition` and\n    `error`.\n\n    ### `willTransition`\n\n    The `willTransition` action is fired at the beginning of any\n    attempted transition with a `Transition` object as the sole\n    argument. This action can be used for aborting, redirecting,\n    or decorating the transition from the currently active routes.\n\n    A good example is preventing navigation when a form is\n    half-filled out:\n\n    ```js\n    App.ContactFormRoute = Ember.Route.extend({\n      actions: {\n        willTransition: function(transition) {\n          if (this.controller.get('userHasEnteredData')) {\n            this.controller.displayNavigationConfirm();\n            transition.abort();\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    You can also redirect elsewhere by calling\n    `this.transitionTo('elsewhere')` from within `willTransition`.\n    Note that `willTransition` will not be fired for the\n    redirecting `transitionTo`, since `willTransition` doesn't\n    fire when there is already a transition underway. If you want\n    subsequent `willTransition` actions to fire for the redirecting\n    transition, you must first explicitly call\n    `transition.abort()`.\n\n    ### `error`\n\n    When attempting to transition into a route, any of the hooks\n    may return a promise that rejects, at which point an `error`\n    action will be fired on the partially-entered routes, allowing\n    for per-route error handling logic, or shared error handling\n    logic defined on a parent route.\n\n    Here is an example of an error handler that will be invoked\n    for rejected promises from the various hooks on the route,\n    as well as any unhandled errors from child routes:\n\n    ```js\n    App.AdminRoute = Ember.Route.extend({\n      beforeModel: function() {\n        return Ember.RSVP.reject(\"bad things!\");\n      },\n\n      actions: {\n        error: function(error, transition) {\n          // Assuming we got here due to the error in `beforeModel`,\n          // we can expect that error === \"bad things!\",\n          // but a promise model rejecting would also\n          // call this hook, as would any errors encountered\n          // in `afterModel`.\n\n          // The `error` hook is also provided the failed\n          // `transition`, which can be stored and later\n          // `.retry()`d if desired.\n\n          this.transitionTo('login');\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    `error` actions that bubble up all the way to `ApplicationRoute`\n    will fire a default error handler that logs the error. You can\n    specify your own global default error handler by overriding the\n    `error` handler on `ApplicationRoute`:\n\n    ```js\n    App.ApplicationRoute = Ember.Route.extend({\n      actions: {\n        error: function(error, transition) {\n          this.controllerFor('banner').displayError(error.message);\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    @property actions\n    @type Hash\n    @default null\n  */\n  _actions: {\n    finalizeQueryParamChange: function(params, finalParams) {\n          }\n  },\n\n  /**\n    @deprecated\n\n    Please use `actions` instead.\n    @method events\n  */\n  events: null,\n\n  mergedProperties: ['events'],\n\n  /**\n    This hook is executed when the router completely exits this route. It is\n    not executed when the model for the route changes.\n\n    @method deactivate\n  */\n  deactivate: Ember.K,\n\n  /**\n    This hook is executed when the router enters the route. It is not executed\n    when the model for the route changes.\n\n    @method activate\n  */\n  activate: Ember.K,\n\n  /**\n    Transition into another route.

You can also just call\n    `this.transitionTo` to another route to implicitly\n    abort the `transition`.\n\n    You can return a promise from this hook to pause the\n    transition until the promise resolves (or rejects).

Note that if an error were to occur, it would\n    be passed to the `error` hook on `Ember.Route`, but\n    it's also possible to handle errors specific to\n    `beforeModel` right from within the hook (to distinguish\n    from the shared error handling behavior of the `error`\n    hook):\n\n    ```js\n    App.PostRoute = Ember.Route.extend({\n      beforeModel: function(transition) {\n        if (!App.Post) {\n          var self = this;\n          return Ember.$.getScript('post.js').then(null, function(e) {\n            self.transitionTo('help');\n\n            // Note that the above transitionTo will implicitly\n            // halt the transition. If you were to return\n            // nothing from this promise reject handler,\n            // according to promise semantics, that would\n            // convert the reject into a resolve and the\n            // transition would continue.

The block\n    for `{{link-to}}` becomes the innerHTML of the rendered\n    element:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery'}}\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n\n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos\">\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    </a>\n    ```\n\n    ### Supplying a tagName\n    By default `{{link-to}}` renders an `<a>` element. This can\n    be overridden for a single use of `{{link-to}}` by supplying\n    a `tagName` option:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' tagName=\"li\"}}\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n\n    ```html\n    <li>\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    </li>\n    ```\n\n    To override this option for your entire application, see\n    \"Overriding Application-wide Defaults\".\n\n    ### Disabling the `link-to` helper\n    By default `{{link-to}}` is enabled.\n    any passed value to `disabled` helper property will disable the `link-to` helper.\n\n    static use: the `disabled` option:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' disabled=true}}\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n\n    dynamic use: the `disabledWhen` option:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' disabledWhen=controller.someProperty}}\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n\n    any passed value to `disabled` will disable it except `undefined`.\n    to ensure that only `true` disable the `link-to` helper you can\n    override the global behaviour of `Ember.LinkView`.\n\n    ```javascript\n    Ember.LinkView.reopen({\n      disabled: Ember.computed(function(key, value) {\n        if (value !== undefined) {\n          this.set('_isDisabled', value === true);\n        }\n        return value === true ? get(this, 'disabledClass') : false;\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n\n    see \"Overriding Application-wide Defaults\" for more.\n\n    ### Handling `href`\n    `{{link-to}}` will use your application's Router to\n    fill the element's `href` property with a url that\n    matches the path to the supplied `routeName` for your\n    routers's configured `Location` scheme, which defaults\n    to Ember.HashLocation.\n\n    ### Handling current route\n    `{{link-to}}` will apply a CSS class name of 'active'\n    when the application's current route matches\n    the supplied routeName. For example, if the application's\n    current route is 'photoGallery.recent' the following\n    use of `{{link-to}}`:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery.recent'}}\n      Great Hamster Photos from the last week\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n\n    will result in\n\n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"active\">\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    </a>\n    ```\n\n    The CSS class name used for active classes can be customized\n    for a single use of `{{link-to}}` by passing an `activeClass`\n    option:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery.recent' activeClass=\"current-url\"}}\n      Great Hamster Photos from the last week\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n\n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"current-url\">\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    </a>\n    ```\n\n    To override this option for your entire application, see\n    \"Overriding Application-wide Defaults\".\n\n    ### Supplying a model\n    An optional model argument can be used for routes whose\n    paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become\n    the model context of the linked route:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.Router.map(function() {\n      this.resource(\"photoGallery\", {path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\"});\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhoto}}\n      {{aPhoto.title}}\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n\n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n      Tomster\n    </a>\n    ```\n\n    ### Supplying multiple models\n    For deep-linking to route paths that contain multiple\n    dynamic segments, multiple model arguments can be used.\n    As the router transitions through the route path, each\n    supplied model argument will become the context for the\n    route with the dynamic segments:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.Router.map(function() {\n      this.resource(\"photoGallery\", {path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\"}, function() {\n        this.route(\"comment\", {path: \"comments/:comment_id\"});\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n    This argument will become the model context of the linked route:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery.comment' aPhoto comment}}\n      {{comment.body}}\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n\n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42/comment/718\">\n      A+++ would snuggle again.\n    </a>\n    ```\n\n    ### Supplying an explicit dynamic segment value\n    If you don't have a model object available to pass to `{{link-to}}`,\n    an optional string or integer argument can be passed for routes whose\n    paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become the value\n    of the dynamic segment:\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.Router.map(function() {\n      this.resource(\"photoGallery\", {path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\"});\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhotoId}}\n      {{aPhoto.title}}\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n\n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n      Tomster\n    </a>\n    ```\n\n    When transitioning into the linked route, the `model` hook will\n    be triggered with parameters including this passed identifier.\n\n    ### Allowing Default Action\n\n   By default the `{{link-to}}` helper prevents the default browser action\n   by calling `preventDefault()` as this sort of action bubbling is normally\n   handled internally and we do not want to take the browser to a new URL (for\n   example).\n\n   If you need to override this behavior specify `preventDefault=false` in\n   your template:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to 'photoGallery' aPhotoId preventDefault=false}}\n      {{aPhotoId.title}}\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n\n    ### Overriding attributes\n    You can override any given property of the Ember.LinkView\n    that is generated by the `{{link-to}}` helper by passing\n    key/value pairs, like so:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#link-to  aPhoto tagName='li' title='Following this link will change your life' classNames='pic sweet'}}\n      Uh-mazing!\n    {{/link-to}}\n    ```\n\n    See [Ember.LinkView](/api/classes/Ember.LinkView.html) for a\n    complete list of overrideable properties. Be sure to also\n    check out inherited properties of `LinkView`.\n\n    ### Overriding Application-wide Defaults\n    ``{{link-to}}`` creates an instance of Ember.LinkView\n    for rendering. To override options for your entire\n    application, reopen Ember.LinkView and supply the\n    desired values:\n\n    ``` javascript\n    Ember.LinkView.reopen({\n      activeClass: \"is-active\",\n      tagName: 'li'\n    })\n    ```\n\n    It is also possible to override the default event in\n    this manner:\n\n    ``` javascript\n    Ember.LinkView.reopen({\n      eventName: 'customEventName'\n    });\n    ```\n\n    @method link-to\n    @for Ember.Handlebars.helpers\n    @param {String} routeName\n    @param {Object} [context]*\n    @param [options] {Object} Handlebars key/value pairs of options, you can override any property of Ember.LinkView\n    @return {String} HTML string\n    @see {Ember.LinkView}\n  */\n  Ember.Handlebars.registerHelper('link-to', function linkToHelper(name) {\n    var options = slice.call(arguments, -1)[0],\n        params = slice.call(arguments, 0, -1),\n        hash = options.hash;\n\n    if (params[params.length - 1] instanceof QueryParams) {\n      hash.queryParamsObject = params.pop();\n    }\n\n    hash.disabledBinding = hash.disabledWhen;\n\n    if (!options.fn) {\n      var linkTitle = params.shift();\n      var linkType = options.types.shift();\n      var context = this;\n      if (linkType === 'ID') {\n        options.linkTextPath = linkTitle;\n        options.fn = function() {\n          return Ember.Handlebars.getEscaped(context, linkTitle, options);\n        };\n      } else {\n        options.fn = function() {\n          return linkTitle;\n        };\n      }\n    }\n\n    hash.parameters = {\n      context: this,\n      options: options,\n      params: params\n    };\n\n    return Ember.Handlebars.helpers.view.call(this, LinkView, options);\n  });\n\n\n  \n  /**\n    See [link-to](/api/classes/Ember.Handlebars.helpers.html#method_link-to)\n\n    @method linkTo\n    @for Ember.Handlebars.helpers\n    @deprecated\n    @param {String} routeName\n    @param {Object} [context]*\n    @return {String} HTML string\n  */\n  Ember.Handlebars.registerHelper('linkTo', function linkToHelper() {\n    Ember.warn(\"The 'linkTo' view helper is deprecated in favor of 'link-to'\");\n    return Ember.Handlebars.helpers['link-to'].apply(this, arguments);\n  });\n});\n\n\n\n})();\n\n\n\n(function() {\n/**\n@module ember\n@submodule ember-routing\n*/\n\nvar get = Ember.get, set = Ember.set;\nEmber.onLoad('Ember.Handlebars', function(Handlebars) {\n  /**\n  @module ember\n  @submodule ember-routing\n  */\n\n  Handlebars.OutletView = Ember.ContainerView.extend(Ember._Metamorph);\n\n  /**\n    The `outlet` helper is a placeholder that the router will fill in with\n    the appropriate template based on the current state of the application.\n\n    ``` handlebars\n    {{outlet}}\n    ```\n\n    By default, a template based on Ember's naming conventions will be rendered\n    into the `outlet` (e.g. `App.PostsRoute` will render the `posts` template).\n\n    You can render a different template by using the `render()` method in the\n    route's `renderTemplate` hook.

In this case, no additional parameters will be passed.\n\n    If you provide additional parameters to the helper:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <button {{action 'edit' post}}>Edit</button>\n    ```\n\n    Those parameters will be passed along as arguments to the JavaScript\n    function implementing the action.\n\n    ### Event Propagation\n\n    Events triggered through the action helper will automatically have\n    `.preventDefault()` called on them. You do not need to do so in your event\n    handlers. If you need to allow event propagation (to handle file inputs for\n    example) you can supply the `preventDefault=false` option to the `{{action}}` helper:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"sayHello\" preventDefault=false}}>\n      <input type=\"file\" />\n      <input type=\"checkbox\" />\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    To disable bubbling, pass `bubbles=false` to the helper:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <button {{action 'edit' post bubbles=false}}>Edit</button>\n    ```\n\n    If you need the default handler to trigger you should either register your\n    own event handler, or use event methods on your view class. See [Ember.View](/api/classes/Ember.View.html)\n    'Responding to Browser Events' for more information.\n\n    ### Specifying DOM event type\n\n    By default the `{{action}}` helper registers for DOM `click` events. You can\n    supply an `on` option to the helper to specify a different DOM event name:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" on=\"doubleClick\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    See `Ember.View` 'Responding to Browser Events' for a list of\n    acceptable DOM event names.\n\n    NOTE: Because `{{action}}` depends on Ember's event dispatch system it will\n    only function if an `Ember.EventDispatcher` instance is available. An\n    `Ember.EventDispatcher` instance will be created when a new `Ember.Application`\n    is created. Having an instance of `Ember.Application` will satisfy this\n    requirement.\n\n    ### Specifying whitelisted modifier keys\n\n    By default the `{{action}}` helper will ignore click event with pressed modifier\n    keys. You can supply an `allowedKeys` option to specify which keys should not be ignored.\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"alt\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    This way the `{{action}}` will fire when clicking with the alt key pressed down.\n\n    Alternatively, supply \"any\" to the `allowedKeys` option to accept any combination of modifier keys.\n\n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"any\"}}>\n      click me with any key pressed\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    ### Specifying a Target\n\n    There are several possible target objects for `{{action}}` helpers:\n\n    In a typical Ember application, where views are managed through use of the\n    `{{outlet}}` helper, actions will bubble to the current controller, then\n    to the current route, and then up the route hierarchy.\n\n    Alternatively, a `target` option can be provided to the helper to change\n    which object will receive the method call. This option must be a path\n    to an object, accessible in the current context:\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{! the application template }}\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" target=view}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n    ```javascript\n    App.ApplicationView = Ember.View.extend({\n      actions: {\n        anActionName: function(){}\n      }\n    });\n\n    ```\n\n    ### Additional Parameters\n\n    You may specify additional parameters to the `{{action}}` helper. These\n    parameters are passed along as the arguments to the JavaScript function\n    implementing the action.\n\n    ```handlebars\n    {{#each person in people}}\n      <div {{action \"edit\" person}}>\n        click me\n      </div>\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n\n    Clicking \"click me\" will trigger the `edit` method on the current controller\n    with the value of `person` as a parameter.\n\n    @method action\n    @for Ember.Handlebars.helpers\n    @param {String} actionName\n    @param {Object} [context]*\n    @param {Hash} options\n  */\n  EmberHandlebars.registerHelper('action', function actionHelper(actionName) {\n    var options = arguments[arguments.length - 1],\n        contexts = a_slice.call(arguments, 1, -1);\n\n    var hash = options.hash,\n        controller;\n\n    // create a hash to pass along to registerAction\n    var action = {\n      eventName: hash.on || \"click\"\n    };\n\n    action.parameters = {\n      context: this,\n      options: options,\n      params: contexts\n    };\n\n    action.view = options.data.view;\n\n    var root, target;\n\n    if (hash.target) {\n      root = this;\n      target = hash.target;\n    } else if (controller = options.data.keywords.controller) {\n      root = controller;\n    }\n\n    action.target = { root: root, target: target, options: options };\n    action.bubbles = hash.bubbles;\n    action.preventDefault = hash.preventDefault;\n    action.boundProperty =  options.types[0] === \"ID\";\n\n    var actionId = ActionHelper.registerAction(actionName, action, hash.allowedKeys);\n    return new SafeString('data-ember-action=\"' + actionId + '\"');\n  });\n\n});\n\n})();\n\n\n\n(function() {\n\n})();\n\n\n\n(function() {\n/**\n@module ember\n@submodule ember-routing\n*/\n\nvar get = Ember.get, set = Ember.set,\n    map = Ember.EnumerableUtils.map;\n\nvar queuedQueryParamChanges = {};\n\nEmber.ControllerMixin.reopen({\n  /**\n    Transition the application into another route.

This relies upon the browser's `history` API.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.Router.map(function() {\n    this.resource('posts', function() {\n      this.route('new');\n    });\n  });\n\n  App.Router.reopen({\n    location: 'history'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  This will result in a posts.new url of `/posts/new`.\n\n  ### NoneLocation\n\n  Using `NoneLocation` causes Ember to not store the applications URL state\n  in the actual URL. This is generally used for testing purposes, and is one\n  of the changes made when calling `App.setupForTesting()`.\n\n  ## Location API\n\n  Each location implementation must provide the following methods:\n\n  * implementation: returns the string name used to reference the implementation.\n  * getURL: returns the current URL.\n  * setURL(path): sets the current URL.\n  * replaceURL(path): replace the current URL (optional).\n  * onUpdateURL(callback): triggers the callback when the URL changes.\n  * formatURL(url): formats `url` to be placed into `href` attribute.\n\n  Calling setURL or replaceURL will not trigger onUpdateURL callbacks.\n\n  @class Location\n  @namespace Ember\n  @static\n*/\nEmber.Location = {\n  /**\n   This is deprecated in favor of using the container to lookup the location\n   implementation as desired.\n\n   For example:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Given a location registered as follows:\n   container.register('location:history-test', HistoryTestLocation);\n\n   // You could create a new instance via:\n   container.lookup('location:history-test');\n   ```\n\n    @method create\n    @param {Object} options\n    @return {Object} an instance of an implementation of the `location` API\n    @deprecated Use the container to lookup the location implementation that you\n    need.\n  */\n  create: function(options) {\n    var implementation = options && options.implementation;\n    Ember.assert(\"Ember.Location.create: you must specify a 'implementation' option\", !!implementation);\n\n    var implementationClass = this.implementations[implementation];\n    Ember.assert(\"Ember.Location.create: \" + implementation + \" is not a valid implementation\", !!implementationClass);\n\n    return implementationClass.create.apply(implementationClass, arguments);\n  },\n\n  /**\n   This is deprecated in favor of using the container to register the\n   location implementation as desired.\n\n   Example:\n\n   ```javascript\n   Application.initializer({\n    name: \"history-test-location\",\n\n    initialize: function(container, application) {\n      application.register('location:history-test', HistoryTestLocation);\n    }\n   });\n   ```\n\n   @method registerImplementation\n   @param {String} name\n   @param {Object} implementation of the `location` API\n   @deprecated Register your custom location implementation with the\n   container directly.\n  */\n  registerImplementation: function(name, implementation) {\n    Ember.deprecate('Using the Ember.Location.registerImplementation is no longer supported.

For example, `controller:post` looks up\n  `App.PostController` by default.\n* there are some nuances (see examples below)\n\n  ### How Resolving Works\n\n  The container calls this object's `resolve` method with the\n  `fullName` argument.\n\n  It first parses the fullName into an object using `parseName`.\n\n  Then it checks for the presence of a type-specific instance\n  method of the form `resolve[Type]` and calls it if it exists.\n  For example if it was resolving 'template:post', it would call\n  the `resolveTemplate` method.\n\n  Its last resort is to call the `resolveOther` method.\n\n  The methods of this object are designed to be easy to override\n  in a subclass.

It helps to instantiate, initialize and coordinate the many\n  objects that make up your app.\n\n  Each Ember app has one and only one `Ember.Application` object. In fact, the\n  very first thing you should do in your application is create the instance:\n\n  ```javascript\n  window.App = Ember.Application.create();\n  ```\n\n  Typically, the application object is the only global variable. All other\n  classes in your app should be properties on the `Ember.Application` instance,\n  which highlights its first role: a global namespace.\n\n  For example, if you define a view class, it might look like this:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App.MyView = Ember.View.extend();\n  ```\n\n  By default, calling `Ember.Application.create()` will automatically initialize\n  your application by calling the `Ember.Application.initialize()` method. If\n  you need to delay initialization, you can call your app's `deferReadiness()`\n  method. When you are ready for your app to be initialized, call its\n  `advanceReadiness()` method.\n\n  You can define a `ready` method on the `Ember.Application` instance, which\n  will be run by Ember when the application is initialized.\n\n  Because `Ember.Application` inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes\n  you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.\n  See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.\n\n  While you can think of your `Ember.Application` as a container that holds the\n  other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities\n  going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand.\n\n  ### Event Delegation\n\n  Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework\n  to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to\n  do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own\n  `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`\n  listener on the `body`.\n\n  If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and\n  start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking\n  their `mouseDown` method as it goes.\n\n  `Ember.Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as\n  well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For\n  example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be\n  called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.\n\n  If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by\n  default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method\n  names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:\n\n  ```javascript\n  App = Ember.Application.create({\n    customEvents: {\n      // add support for the paste event\n      paste: \"paste\"\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document\n  body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside\n  an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element\n  inside the body.\n\n  For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`\n  should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:\n\n  ```javascript\n  window.App = Ember.Application.create({\n    rootElement: '#ember-app'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector\n  string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will\n  not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only\n  append views inside it!\n\n  To learn more about the advantages of event delegation and the Ember view\n  layer, and a list of the event listeners that are setup by default, visit the\n  [Ember View Layer guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/understanding-ember/the-view-layer/#toc_event-delegation).\n\n  ### Initializers\n\n  Libraries on top of Ember can register additional initializers, like so:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Ember.Application.initializer({\n    name: \"store\",\n\n    initialize: function(container, application) {\n      container.register('store:main', application.Store);\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ### Routing\n\n  In addition to creating your application's router, `Ember.Application` is\n  also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions\n  between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more\n  detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with\n  the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:\n\n  ```javascript\n  window.App = Ember.Application.create({\n    LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions\n    LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps\n  });\n  ```\n\n  By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into\n  application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you\n  need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`\n  method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.\n\n  If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a\n  `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing\n  begins.\n  ```\n\n  @class Application\n  @namespace Ember\n  @extends Ember.Namespace\n*/\n\nvar Application = Ember.Application = Ember.Namespace.extend(Ember.DeferredMixin, {\n\n  /**\n    The root DOM element of the Application.

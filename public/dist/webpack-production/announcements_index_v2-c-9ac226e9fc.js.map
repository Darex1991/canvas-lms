Essentially combines a bunch of promise operations\n * into a single promise and limits the number of concurrent promises.\n *\n * Useful for when you need to execute a large number of promises in a single operation, but you want\n * to limit the number of promises running at the same time.\n *\n * For example, if you need to make 100 API calls to update 100 different items, but don't want to\n * overload the application by doing them all at once, you can use a promise pool of size 5 to only\n * run a maximum of 5 API calls at the same time.\n *\n * @param {array} dataList list of items for which we need to run a promise task for\n * @param {function} makePromise function that takes in an item from dataList and returns a promise\n * @param {poolSize, intervalTime} opts optional options for the promise pool\n * poolSize: maximum number of promises to run at the same time\n * intervalTime: how often to check on the progress of the promises\n *\n * @returns Promise that resolves when all tasks are done. Promise result contains successes and\n * failures properties representing which tasks succeeded and failed\n *\n * @example\n * const dataList = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']\n *\n * function deleteItem (id) {\n *  return axios.delete('/api/v1/items/' + id)\n * }\n *\n * const opts = { poolSize: 2 }\n *\n * // in this example we have to delete a bunch of items, but we don't wanna overload the backend\n * // with a bunch of simultaneous requests so we use makePromisePool to execute a max of 2 at a time\n * makePromisePool(dataList, deleteItem, opts)\n *   .then(results => {\n *      console.log(results.successes.length, 'items successfully deleted')\n *      console.log(results.failures.length, 'failed to delete')\n *   })\n */\nexport default function makePromisePool(dataList, makePromise, opts = {}) {\n  const poolSize = opts.poolSize || 5\n  const intervalTime = opts.intervalTime || 300\n\n  return new Promise(resolve => {\n    const successes = []\n    const failures = []\n    let activeWorkers = 0\n    let dataIndex = 0\n\n    function queueNextPromise() {\n      const data = dataList[dataIndex++]\n      activeWorkers++\n      makePromise(data)\n        .then(res => {\n          successes.push({data, res})\n          activeWorkers--\n        })\n        .catch(err => {\n          failures.push({data, err})\n          activeWorkers--\n        })\n    }\n\n    function evaluateProgress() {\n      // if there are still items to process\n      if (dataIndex < dataList.length) {\n        // while there are items to process and we have room in our pool..\n        while (dataIndex < dataList.length && activeWorkers < poolSize) {\n          queueNextPromise()\n        }\n\n        // check on the progress again after an interval timeout\n        setTimeout(evaluateProgress, intervalTime)\n      } else {\n        // check that all workers are actually done\n        if (activeWorkers === 0) {\n          // looks like all our promises finished executing, so lets return results\n          resolve({successes, failures})\n        } else {\n          // check on the progress again after an interval timeout\n          setTimeout(evaluateProgress, intervalTime)\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    // startup the promise pool\n    evaluateProgress()\n  })\n}\n","/*\n * Copyright (C) 2017 - present Instructure, Inc.\n *\n * This file is part of Canvas.\n *\n * Canvas is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\n * the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free\n * Software Foundation, version 3 of the License.\n *\n * Canvas is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\n * WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR\n * A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
